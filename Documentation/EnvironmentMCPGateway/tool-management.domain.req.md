## **CAPABILITY OVERVIEW**
The Tool Management capability provides comprehensive environment awareness for the existing 43+ MCP tools through intelligent classification, automatic environment context injection, and enhanced tool discovery systems. This capability transforms the MCP Gateway's tool ecosystem from localhost-focused operations into enterprise-scale environment-aware workflows while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing tool interfaces.

The capability enables automatic classification of tools by environment awareness requirements (environment-aware vs environment-agnostic), provides intelligent routing of environment-aware tools to appropriate target environments, and delivers enhanced tool visibility through comprehensive categorization and search capabilities. The system seamlessly integrates with the Environment Registry capability to provide context-aware tool execution without requiring changes to existing tool implementations.

**Core Business Responsibility:** Environment-aware tool management system that enables intelligent tool routing and enhanced tool discovery while preserving backward compatibility with existing MCP tool ecosystem.

**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Improved tool discovery with comprehensive categorization, filtering, and usage examples reducing time to find appropriate tools
- **Environment-Aware Operations**: Intelligent tool routing to appropriate environments with automatic context injection eliminating manual environment parameter specification
- **Operational Visibility**: Complete tool inventory with environment awareness classification providing clear understanding of tool capabilities and requirements

## **DOMAIN BOUNDARIES AND CONTEXT**

### **Bounded Context Definition**
**Domain Boundaries (Critical DDD Principle):**
Define clear ownership to prevent model corruption and maintain domain autonomy.

**What This Domain Owns (Complete Responsibility):**
- **Tool Classification Framework**: Complete categorization of all MCP tools by environment awareness requirements with metadata management and classification rules
- **Environment Context Routing**: Tool routing logic that determines appropriate environment targets based on tool classification and session context
- **Tool Registry Enhancement**: Enhanced tool discovery, categorization display, filtering, and search capabilities built on existing tool registry foundation
- **Environment Management Tools**: New MCP tools specifically for environment registry CRUD operations, validation, and management workflows

**What This Domain Does NOT Own (Explicit Exclusions):**
- **MCP Tool Definitions**: We enhance tool metadata but do not modify existing tool implementations or interfaces
- **Environment Registry Data**: Owned by Environment Registry domain - we consume environment context and routing data
- **Session Management**: Owned by existing Session Management - we integrate with existing session architecture for environment context
- **Transport Protocol**: Owned by existing Transport layer - we use existing HTTP/SSE transport for enhanced tool communication

**Boundary Violations to Avoid:**
- DO NOT modify existing MCP tool implementations or change tool interfaces
- DO NOT create separate environment registry functionality that duplicates Environment Registry domain
- DO NOT implement session management functionality that bypasses existing session architecture

### **Ubiquitous Language**

| Domain Term | Business Definition | Code Representation | Usage Rules |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Tool Classification | Categorization of MCP tools by environment awareness requirements | `ToolClassificationMetadata` record | Applied to all MCP tools, determines routing and context injection behavior |
| Environment Context Injection | Automatic addition of environment parameters to environment-aware tools | `IEnvironmentContextInjector` interface | Applied only to environment-aware tools, preserves existing tool interfaces |
| Tool Category Display | Enhanced tool organization and discovery interface | `EnhancedToolCategoryDisplay` class | User-facing tool browsing with filtering, search, and categorization |
| Environment Routing | Logic determining appropriate environment targets for tool execution | `EnvironmentRoutingEngine` domain service | Routes environment-aware tools to registered environments based on session context |

**Language Consistency Rules:**
- All code classes/methods MUST use exact business terminology from this table
- Tests MUST use business language: "should route database tool to development environment"
- API endpoints MUST reflect business operations: `/tool-registry/classify-tools` not `/tools/categorize`
- Database table/column names MUST match domain terms: `tool_classification_metadata`, `environment_routing_rules`
- Cross-team communication MUST use these exact terms when discussing tool management enhancement

**Terms to Avoid (Anti-Patterns):**
- "Tool Manager" instead of "Tool Classification Framework"
- "Context Provider" instead of "Environment Context Injection"
- Generic terms like "Handler", "Processor", "Manager" for tool-specific concepts
- CRUD terminology instead of business operations: "create classification" vs "classify tools"

### **Context Map Integration**

| Related Domain | DDD Relationship | Integration Pattern | Dependency Direction | Reference Document |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Environment Registry | **Customer/Supplier** | API/Event | We depend on them for environment context | environment-registry.domain.req.md |
| Diagnostics Framework | **Supplier/Customer** | API | They depend on us for tool classification | diagnostics-framework.domain.req.md |
| Existing Tool Registry | **Conformist** | Enhancement API | We build upon existing tool registry | (existing architecture) |
| Session Management | **Conformist** | Session API | We adapt to existing session architecture | (existing architecture) |

**DDD Relationship Definitions:**
- **Customer/Supplier**: We consume environment context from Environment Registry for tool routing
- **Supplier/Customer**: We provide tool classification data to Diagnostics Framework
- **Conformist**: We enhance existing Tool Registry and Session Management without modifying core behavior

**Integration Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Direct modification of existing tool registry data structures
- Bypassing environment registry API for environment context access
- Creating separate session management for environment context
