## **CAPABILITY OVERVIEW**
The Transport Architecture capability provides comprehensive cleanup and standardization of the MCP Gateway transport layer by removing SSE interface confusion and consolidating all client communication through optimized HTTP transport. This capability eliminates the dual transport complexity that creates connection ambiguity while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing MCP clients and preserving all current functionality and performance characteristics.

The capability enables streamlined client connectivity by providing a single, well-defined HTTP transport interface that supports all existing MCP operations, multi-client session coordination, and environment-aware tool routing. The cleanup process follows expert-validated security patterns and migration strategies to ensure safe removal of SSE transport without disrupting existing client connections or degrading system performance.

**Core Business Responsibility:** Transport layer consolidation that eliminates connection confusion through SSE removal and HTTP transport standardization while preserving all existing functionality and security requirements.

**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Connection Clarity**: Single HTTP transport interface eliminates client connection confusion and reduces support overhead for transport-related issues
- **Maintenance Simplification**: Removal of duplicate transport logic reduces codebase complexity and maintenance burden while improving system reliability
- **Security Standardization**: Unified HTTP transport enables consistent security patterns, authentication mechanisms, and audit logging across all client connections

## **DOMAIN BOUNDARIES AND CONTEXT**

### **Bounded Context Definition**
**Domain Boundaries (Critical DDD Principle):**
Define clear ownership to prevent model corruption and maintain domain autonomy.

**What This Domain Owns (Complete Responsibility):**
- **Transport Layer Configuration**: Complete configuration and management of HTTP transport settings, connection parameters, and transport-level security
- **SSE Interface Removal**: Safe removal of Server-Sent Events transport interface including cleanup of SSE-specific code and configuration
- **HTTP Transport Optimization**: Performance optimization, connection pooling, request routing, and HTTP-specific feature implementation
- **Transport Migration Management**: Migration procedures, rollback strategies, and compatibility validation during transport standardization

**What This Domain Does NOT Own (Explicit Exclusions):**
- **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Owned by existing MCP protocol layer - we provide transport but not protocol logic
- **Session Management**: Owned by existing Session Management - we integrate with existing session architecture
- **Tool Execution Logic**: Owned by Tool Management domain - we provide transport for tool communication
- **Client Application Logic**: We provide transport interface but do not control client application implementations

**Boundary Violations to Avoid:**
- DO NOT modify MCP protocol message formats or communication patterns
- DO NOT implement session management functionality that bypasses existing session architecture
- DO NOT change tool execution interfaces beyond transport layer modifications

### **Ubiquitous Language**

| Domain Term | Business Definition | Code Representation | Usage Rules |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Transport Consolidation | Process of standardizing all MCP communication through single HTTP transport | `TransportConsolidationEngine` class | Orchestrates migration from dual transport to HTTP-only |
| SSE Interface Removal | Safe elimination of Server-Sent Events transport with connection preservation | `SSERemovalStrategy` domain service | Manages SSE cleanup without disrupting existing connections |
| HTTP Transport Standardization | Optimization and standardization of HTTP transport for all MCP communications | `HTTPTransportStandardizer` class | Ensures consistent HTTP transport behavior and performance |
| Transport Migration | Controlled transition from dual transport to HTTP-only with safety validation | `TransportMigrationOrchestrator` domain service | Coordinates migration phases with rollback capability |

**Language Consistency Rules:**
- All code classes/methods MUST use exact business terminology from this table
- Tests MUST use business language: "should consolidate transport to HTTP-only without connection loss"
- API endpoints MUST reflect business operations: `/transport/consolidate` not `/transport/migrate`
- Database table/column names MUST match domain terms: `transport_consolidation_status`, `sse_removal_progress`
- Cross-team communication MUST use these exact terms when discussing transport cleanup

**Terms to Avoid (Anti-Patterns):**
- "Transport Switcher" instead of "Transport Consolidation"
- "SSE Disabler" instead of "SSE Interface Removal"
- Generic terms like "Migrator", "Cleaner", "Optimizer" for transport-specific concepts
- Technical jargon that obscures business purpose of transport standardization

### **Context Map Integration**

| Related Domain | DDD Relationship | Integration Pattern | Dependency Direction | Reference Document |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Session Management | **Conformist** | HTTP Session API | We adapt to existing session patterns | (existing architecture) |
| MCP Protocol | **Conformist** | Protocol API | We provide transport for existing protocol | (existing architecture) |
| Environment Registry | **Supplier/Customer** | HTTP Transport | They depend on us for standardized transport | environment-registry.domain.req.md |

| Diagnostics Framework | **Supplier/Customer** | HTTP Transport | They depend on us for diagnostic communication | diagnostics-framework.domain.req.md |

**DDD Relationship Definitions:**
- **Conformist**: We adapt to existing Session Management and MCP Protocol without changing their interfaces
- **Supplier/Customer**: We provide standardized HTTP transport to all other MCP Gateway capabilities

**Integration Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Creating custom session management that bypasses existing session architecture
- Modifying MCP protocol patterns beyond transport layer standardization
- Breaking existing client compatibility through transport changes
