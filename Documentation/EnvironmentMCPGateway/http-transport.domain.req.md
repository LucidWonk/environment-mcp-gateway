## **CAPABILITY OVERVIEW**

This domain capability provides HTTP/SSE transport architecture for the EnvironmentMCPGateway, enabling multiple concurrent Claude Code instances to access the comprehensive suite of 43+ MCP tools simultaneously. The capability transforms the current single-client STDIO architecture into a multi-client HTTP-based system while maintaining full backward compatibility and preserving all existing tool functionality.

**Core Business Responsibility:** Enable collaborative development workflows through concurrent MCP server access without functionality degradation.

**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Development Team Productivity**: Multiple developers can simultaneously access Context Engineering and infrastructure tools
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Enable team-based Context Engineering operations with preserved approval gates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing STDIO clients continue working during transition period

## **BUSINESS RULES**

### **Rule 1: Transport Protocol Compliance**
**Rule ID**: HTTP-001
**Category**: Integration
**Priority**: Must Have

The HTTP transport implementation MUST maintain complete MCP protocol compliance across both STDIO and HTTP/SSE transport mechanisms.

**Business Justification**: Protocol compliance ensures existing Claude Code integrations continue working without modification.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- SSEServerTransport must implement identical MCP protocol interfaces as StdioServerTransport
- All 43+ existing MCP tools must function identically across transport types
- Message format and tool execution patterns must remain unchanged
- Client-server communication must follow MCP specification exactly

**Validation Criteria:**
- All existing MCP tools execute with identical results across STDIO and HTTP transports
- MCP protocol compliance tests pass for both transport mechanisms
- Client connection establishment follows MCP standards for SSE transport

### **Rule 2: Session Management and Client Coordination**
**Rule ID**: HTTP-002  
**Category**: Architecture
**Priority**: Must Have

Multi-client session management MUST coordinate concurrent access to shared resources while maintaining tool execution isolation between clients.

**Business Justification**: Prevents conflicts during collaborative development while enabling independent tool execution per client session.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Unique session identification for each connected client
- Session lifecycle management (connect, identify, track, disconnect)
- Concurrent access coordination for Context Engineering shared resources
- Tool execution result routing to correct client session
- Session cleanup and resource management

**Validation Criteria:**
- Multiple clients connect simultaneously without conflicts
- Tool execution results reach only the requesting client
- Shared resource access coordinates properly across sessions
- Session disconnection doesn't affect other active sessions

### **Rule 3: Backward Compatibility Preservation**
**Rule ID**: HTTP-003
**Category**: Compatibility  
**Priority**: Must Have

The HTTP transport implementation MUST preserve full backward compatibility with existing STDIO-based client configurations during transition period.

**Business Justification**: Enables gradual migration without breaking existing development workflows or deployment configurations.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Dual transport support through configuration selection
- STDIO client configurations continue working unchanged
- Feature parity between STDIO and HTTP transport mechanisms
- Environment variable controls for transport type selection
- Migration path from STDIO to HTTP transport

**Validation Criteria:**
- Existing STDIO clients continue working without modification
- Configuration migration path tested and validated
- Feature parity maintained across both transport types
- Transport selection configuration functions correctly

### **Rule 4: Context Engineering Integration Preservation**
**Rule ID**: HTTP-004
**Category**: Integration
**Priority**: Must Have

Multi-client HTTP transport MUST preserve Context Engineering approval gates and holistic update coordination patterns exactly as they function in single-client scenarios.

**Business Justification**: Maintains Context Engineering system integrity and human oversight requirements during collaborative workflows.

**Technical Implementation Requirements:**
- Human approval gates function identically in multi-client scenarios
- Holistic context updates coordinate across all active client sessions
- Cross-session coordination for Context Engineering shared operations
- Approval gate preservation regardless of originating client session
- Context integrity maintained during concurrent operations

**Validation Criteria:**
- Approval gates preserve human authority in multi-client scenarios
- Holistic updates coordinate properly across concurrent sessions
- Context Engineering workflows maintain system integrity
- Cross-session coordination prevents context conflicts
