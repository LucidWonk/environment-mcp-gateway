## **HOW THIS WORKS: COMPLETE SYSTEM EXPLANATION**

**For AI Assistants in New Sessions**: This section provides explicit, step-by-step explanation of how the Virtual Expert Team system works, eliminating the need to infer connections or guess at implied context.

### **Architecture Overview: Three Layers**

The Virtual Expert Team v5.1 operates across three distinct architectural layers:

**Layer 1: MCP Server Infrastructure** (EnvironmentMCPGateway)
- **Location**: `/EnvironmentMCPGateway/src/tools/virtual-expert-team.ts` and supporting files
- **Responsibility**: Provides MCP tools that the main agent (you, the Claude Code session) calls to get expert selection, context packaging, conflict detection, and validation services
- **Key Components**: Expert selection algorithm, context packaging utilities, conflict detection, validation framework, semantic aggregation engine
- **Output**: MCP tool results containing expert selections, packaged contexts, agent prompts, conflict analyses

**Layer 2: Template System** (Context Engineering Templates)
- **Location**: `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/*.icp.md` and kickstarter
- **Responsibility**: Provides markdown instructions that guide the main agent on WHEN and HOW to use expert consultation
- **Key Components**: Agent coordination patterns (3x3 block structures), expert dispatch decision trees, result synthesis protocols
- **Output**: Clear instructions the main agent follows to orchestrate expert consultation workflows

**Layer 3: Task Tool Agents** (Sonnet 4.5 Execution Layer)
- **Location**: Executed dynamically via Claude Code's Task tool (not stored files)
- **Responsibility**: Virtual expert personas that analyze code, provide recommendations, validate implementations
- **Key Components**: 8 expert personas (Financial Quant, Cybersecurity, Architecture, Performance, QA, DevOps, Process Engineer, Context Engineering Compliance)
- **Output**: Expert recommendations, analysis findings, validation results

### **Complete Workflow: Step-by-Step Example**

**Scenario**: You (main agent) are implementing a new trading algorithm feature that requires Analysis domain to consume data from the Data domain.

**STEP 1: Template Instructs Expert Consultation**
- You're executing a Codification ICP or Implementation ICP template
- Template contains: "BLOCK 1: PREPARATION - Expert Selection and Agent Setup"
- Template instruction: "Call `expert-select-workflow` MCP tool with workflow description and file paths"
- **Explicit Action**: You make MCP tool call to EnvironmentMCPGateway

**STEP 2: MCP Server Analyzes Workflow**
- EnvironmentMCPGateway receives your `expert-select-workflow` call
- Expert Selection Algorithm (ve01) analyzes:
  - Component paths: `Utility/Analysis/`, `Utility/Data/`
  - Workflow type: Cross-domain integration
  - Risk level: Medium (trading algorithm changes)
  - Complexity: Complex (multi-domain coordination)
- Algorithm determines needed experts:
  - Primary: Architecture Expert (cross-domain integration focus)
  - Secondary: Financial Quant Expert (trading algorithm validation)
  - Mandatory: Context Engineering Compliance Agent (process compliance)

**STEP 3: MCP Server Generates Task Agent Prompts**
- For each selected expert, algorithm generates complete Task agent prompt:
  - Loads expert persona base template from Virtual Expert Persona Library (ve05)
  - Injects project standards via ProjectDocumentationLoader:
    - For Architecture Expert: Development Guidelines, DDD principles, integration patterns
    - For Financial Quant: Trading algorithm standards, Fibonacci methodology
    - For Context Engineering: Template compliance requirements
  - Embeds the specific subtask: "Validate cross-domain integration: Analysis → Data"
- Determines execution strategy:
  - Parallel Group 1: [Architecture Expert, Financial Quant Expert] (can run concurrently)
  - Sequential: Context Engineering Compliance Agent (waits for others to complete)
- MCP tool returns enhanced selection result with ready-to-use agent prompts

**STEP 4: MCP Server Packages Context**
- You (main agent) call `context-transfer-utility` or `aggregate-project-context` MCP tool
- Full-Context Packaging (ve07) activates:
  - Determines scope: cross-domain (Analysis + Data domains needed)
  - Calls Multi-Document Semantic Aggregation (ve08):
    - Reads `Utility/Analysis/analysis.domain.req.md`
    - Reads `Utility/Data/data.domain.req.md`
    - Reads `Documentation/Architecture/development-guidelines.domain.req.md`
    - Loads `.context/domain-overview.md`, `.context/integration-points.md` from both domains (generated by git hooks)
  - Builds semantic graph:
    - Domain boundary: Analysis ↔ Data
    - Integration contract: `IMarketDataProvider` interface
    - Dependencies: Analysis depends on Data via messaging
  - Creates navigation index for 200K token context
  - Generates integrity hash
- Returns aggregated context package (ephemeral, in-memory only, ~18,000 tokens)

**STEP 5: You Dispatch Task Agents in Parallel**
- Template instruction: "BLOCK 2: EXECUTION - Parallel Expert Consultation"
- You send **single message** with **multiple Task tool calls**:
  ```
  Task Agent 1 (Architecture Expert):
    Prompt: [Generated by ve01 with injected standards]
    Context: [Aggregated package from ve08]

  Task Agent 2 (Financial Quant Expert):
    Prompt: [Generated by ve01 with injected standards]
    Context: [Aggregated package from ve08]
  ```
- Both agents execute concurrently (Sonnet 4.5 parallel execution)
- Each agent independently analyzes using full 200K token context with semantic navigation

**STEP 6: Task Agents Return Results**
- Architecture Expert returns:
  - "Integration contract via `IMarketDataProvider` is well-designed"
  - "Recommend adding async/await pattern for data fetching"
  - "Domain boundary preservation looks correct"
  - Confidence: 0.9

- Financial Quant Expert returns:
  - "Trading algorithm correctly handles data gaps"
  - "Recommend adding validation for stale data timestamps"
  - "Position sizing logic needs adjustment for multi-timeframe"
  - Confidence: 0.85

**STEP 7: You Synthesize Results**
- Template instruction: "BLOCK 3: INTEGRATION - Expert Result Synthesis"
- You collect both agent results
- You call `expert-conflict-resolve` MCP tool (ve03) with both results
- Conflict Detection with AI Mediation analyzes:
  - Agreement: Both agree integration is sound
  - Minor conflict: Architecture wants async/await, Financial Quant wants validation checks
  - Conflict type: Compatible (not mutually exclusive)
  - AI Mediation (v5.1 NEW): Synthesizes "Implement both recommendations - async/await for performance, validation for correctness"
  - Escalation: NOT NEEDED (compatible recommendations, auto-resolved)
- You present synthesized recommendations to human for review

**STEP 8: Human Approval Gate**
- Template instruction: "**STOP GATE**: Human review of expert guidance before proceeding"
- You present:
  - Architecture Expert findings
  - Financial Quant Expert findings
  - AI-mediated synthesis
  - Recommendation: Proceed with both async/await and validation
- Human types "continue"

**STEP 9: You Implement with Expert Guidance**
- You implement the integration following expert recommendations
- You add async/await pattern (Architecture Expert recommendation)
- You add stale data validation (Financial Quant Expert recommendation)
- You adjust position sizing logic (Financial Quant Expert recommendation)

**STEP 10: Agent-Assisted Deep Validation (Optional)**
- After implementation, you call `expert-validate-implementation` MCP tool with scope: "comprehensive"
- Validation Framework (ve06) detects comprehensive scope
- Dispatches validation Task agents:
  - Same experts who provided recommendations now validate implementation
  - Architecture Expert validates: async/await correctly implemented
  - Financial Quant Expert validates: data validation and position sizing correct
- Validation agents return >95% compliance score
- You present validation results to human

**STEP 11: Metrics Tracking**
- Agent Coordination Metrics (ve09) automatically tracks:
  - Expert selection: Architecture + Financial Quant selected (correct for cross-domain integration)
  - Execution times: Agent 1 (23 seconds), Agent 2 (19 seconds)
  - Parallel efficiency: 42 seconds total (vs. 42 seconds sequential) = 0% overhead (perfect parallelization)
  - Conflict resolution: 1 conflict, auto-resolved via AI mediation
  - Recommendation adoption: 100% (all recommendations implemented)
  - Validation compliance: 97% (high quality implementation)
- Metrics validate business value hypothesis

### **Key System Components Explained**

**What Are "Task Agents"?**
- Task agents are independent Sonnet 4.5 instances dispatched via Claude Code's Task tool
- They execute in parallel (multiple agents can run at the same time)
- Each receives its own prompt (expert persona template) and context package
- They return results independently without coordinating with each other
- The main agent (you) synthesizes their results

**What is "Full-Context Packaging"?**
- Sonnet 4.5 can handle 200K tokens of context (very large amount of information)
- Instead of filtering context to small chunks (v4.0 approach), v5.1 gives agents complete context
- Includes: domain documents, .context files, architectural standards, integration contracts
- Semantic indexing helps agents navigate large context efficiently
- Result: Agents see the complete picture, not filtered fragments

**What is "Multi-Document Semantic Aggregation"?**
- WHEN: Cross-domain work requires knowledge from multiple bounded contexts
- HOW: MCP server reads 5-10 domain *.req.md documents + their .context files
- WHAT: Creates unified view with semantic links (domain boundaries, integration contracts)
- IMPORTANT: Read-only, ephemeral (exists only in memory, never writes to disk)
- WHY: Preserves DDD bounded context separation while giving agents holistic view
- EXAMPLE: Analysis + Data domains aggregated, but their separation clearly marked

**What Are ".context Files"?**
- Generated automatically by git hooks every time you commit code
- Location: `<domain>/.context/` (e.g., `Utility/Analysis/.context/`)
- Content: `domain-overview.md`, `integration-points.md`, `business-rules.md`, `recent-changes.md`
- Purpose: Rich semantic summaries of what code ACTUALLY does (vs. what requirements say it SHOULD do)
- v5.1 Relationship: MCP server READS these files as inputs for context packages (doesn't modify them)

**What is "AI-Powered Conflict Mediation"?**
- WHEN: Multiple Task agents return conflicting recommendations
- DETECTION: Conflict Detection (ve03) analyzes disagreements
- CLASSIFICATION: Compatible (can be synthesized) vs. Critical (requires human judgment)
- MEDIATION: For compatible conflicts, Sonnet 4.5 reasons through both positions and synthesizes unified recommendation
- ESCALATION: For critical conflicts, structured escalation to human with complete context
- RESULT: 60-70% of conflicts auto-resolved, 30-40% escalated to human

**What is "Template Authority"?**
- Templates (Codification ICP, Implementation ICP) control workflow execution
- Templates tell you WHEN to use expert consultation
- Templates tell you HOW to dispatch Task agents
- Task agents provide recommendations (advisory role)
- Human makes final decisions (ultimate authority)
- You (main agent) orchestrate based on template instructions + human approvals

### **Infrastructure Relationships Explained**

**MCP Tools You Call:**
- `expert-select-workflow`: Analyzes workflow, returns expert selections + agent prompts
- `context-transfer-utility`: Packages context for Task agent dispatch
- `aggregate-project-context`: Aggregates multiple domain documents for cross-domain work
- `expert-conflict-resolve`: Detects conflicts in multi-agent results, attempts AI mediation
- `expert-validate-implementation`: Validates implementation against expert recommendations
- `expert-get-project-standards`: Retrieves project standards for specific expert type

**Git Hooks Relationship:**
- **What They Do**: Automatically generate `.context/*` files on every git commit
- **Who Owns Them**: Context Engineering System (separate from VET)
- **VET Relationship**: VET READS .context files as high-quality semantic inputs
- **Important**: VET never modifies .context files, only reads them

**Template Integration:**
- **Where Templates Live**: `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/template.codification.icp.md`, `template.implementation.icp.md`
- **What They Provide**: "Agent Coordination Patterns" sections with 3x3 block structure
- **How You Use Them**: Follow template instructions to know when to call MCP tools and dispatch Task agents
- **Explicit Instructions**: Templates say "Call expert-select-workflow MCP tool", "Dispatch Task agents in parallel", "Synthesize results"

**Domain Document Preservation (DDD):**
- **Source Documents**: `Utility/Analysis/analysis.domain.req.md`, `Utility/Data/data.domain.req.md` (stay exactly where they are)
- **VET Access**: Read-only (VET never modifies these documents)
- **Aggregation**: When needed for cross-domain work, VET creates ephemeral in-memory view
- **After Use**: Aggregated view discarded, source documents unchanged
- **Why Important**: Preserves DDD bounded context separation while enabling holistic expert consultation

### **Performance Characteristics Explained**

**Why Parallel Execution Matters:**
- **Sequential (v4.0)**: Agent 1 finishes (23s) → THEN Agent 2 starts → Agent 2 finishes (19s) = 42 seconds total
- **Parallel (v5.1)**: Agent 1 and Agent 2 start simultaneously → Both finish after max(23s, 19s) = 23 seconds total
- **Improvement**: 42s → 23s = 45% faster (validates 40-60% improvement hypothesis)
- **Overhead**: <2% coordination time (preparing contexts and synthesizing results)

**Why Full-Context Improves Quality:**
- **v4.0 Filtered Context**: Agent sees 2,000 tokens (limited view, misses integration details)
- **v5.1 Full Context**: Agent sees 18,000 tokens (complete system view, sees all integration contracts)
- **Result**: Better cross-domain recommendations (agent understands complete integration landscape)
- **Trade-off**: None (Sonnet 4.5 handles 200K tokens natively, so no performance cost)

**Why Metrics Matter:**
- **Validation**: Proves 40-60% performance improvement hypothesis is accurate
- **ROI**: Demonstrates business value (recommendation adoption rate, quality improvement)
- **Continuous Improvement**: Identifies bottlenecks (slow experts, high-conflict pairs)
- **Transparency**: Shows human stakeholders that expert system delivers value

### **What You (Main Agent) Should Do**

**When Starting a New Task:**
1. Read the ICP template you're executing
2. Follow template instructions for expert consultation
3. Call MCP tools as instructed (expert-select-workflow, context-transfer-utility, etc.)
4. Dispatch Task agents using prompts provided by MCP tools
5. Synthesize multi-agent results using conflict detection tool
6. Present recommendations to human for approval
7. Implement with expert guidance
8. Validate using agent-assisted validation (optional)

**When You See "STOP GATE" in Templates:**
- STOP immediately
- Present expert recommendations to human
- Wait for explicit human approval ("continue")
- Do NOT proceed without approval

**When Task Agents Disagree:**
- Call `expert-conflict-resolve` MCP tool with all agent results
- Review AI mediation synthesis
- If synthesis successful, present to human for approval
- If escalated as critical conflict, present disagreement to human for decision

**When Implementing Cross-Domain Features:**
- Call `aggregate-project-context` for holistic view
- Dispatch Task agents with aggregated context
- Ensure integration contracts are clearly defined
- Validate domain boundaries are preserved

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`

**v5.1 Architectural Innovation**: This domain specification represents a sophisticated evolution from v4.0's synchronous orchestration to Task tool native parallelization. The key insight is recognizing that Sonnet 4.5's capabilities (200K context window, Task tool parallel execution, enhanced reasoning) obsolete much of the v4.0 coordination infrastructure. By eliminating ~1,730 LOC of orchestration complexity and replacing it with simpler Task agent utilities (~2,360 LOC net), we achieve superior performance (40-60% improvement) through architectural simplification rather than optimization of complex systems.

**Full-Context Packaging Rationale**: v4.0's context filtering approach (full/focused/minimal) was designed for models with limited context windows. Sonnet 4.5's 200K token capacity makes filtering counterproductive - experts can now see complete system context, integration landscapes, and architectural constraints simultaneously, leading to holistic recommendations impossible with filtered views. The semantic indexing and navigation markers guide expert attention without removing information.

**Multi-Document Aggregation and DDD**: The semantic aggregation capability carefully balances two competing needs: (1) DDD's requirement for strict bounded context separation in documentation, and (2) AI experts' need to understand cross-domain integration holistically. The solution is ephemeral, read-only aggregation that exists only in-memory during Task agent dispatch, never modifying source documents or blurring bounded contexts. The semantic graph explicitly marks domain boundaries and integration contracts, reinforcing rather than violating DDD principles.
