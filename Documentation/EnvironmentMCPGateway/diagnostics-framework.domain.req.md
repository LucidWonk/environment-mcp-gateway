## **CAPABILITY OVERVIEW**
The Diagnostics Framework capability provides comprehensive system health validation across multiple environments through automated connectivity testing, service validation, and real-time diagnostic execution. This capability replaces the existing limited self-diagnostics with enterprise-scale validation that tests MCP Gateway connectivity to all registered environments, validates service functionality across different environment types, and provides actionable error reporting optimized for automated resolution through Claude Code workflows.

The capability enables proactive system monitoring by continuously validating environment connectivity, detecting service degradation before it impacts development workflows, and providing structured diagnostic results that enable both human troubleshooting and automated remediation. The framework integrates seamlessly with the Environment Registry and Tool Management capabilities to provide comprehensive coverage of all MCP Gateway functionality across all registered environments.

**Core Business Responsibility:** Comprehensive diagnostic system that validates MCP Gateway functionality and environment connectivity across all registered environments with actionable reporting for proactive issue resolution.

**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Comprehensive connectivity and service validation prevents environment issues from impacting development workflows through early detection and alerting
- **Operational Visibility**: Real-time system health status across all environments and services provides clear operational insights and reduces troubleshooting time
- **Automated Resolution Support**: Structured diagnostic results with actionable recommendations enable Claude Code to automatically resolve common infrastructure issues

## **DOMAIN BOUNDARIES AND CONTEXT**

### **Bounded Context Definition**
**Domain Boundaries (Critical DDD Principle):**
Define clear ownership to prevent model corruption and maintain domain autonomy.

**What This Domain Owns (Complete Responsibility):**
- **Diagnostic Execution Framework**: Complete diagnostic test execution across all environments with result aggregation and reporting
- **System Health Validation**: Comprehensive validation of MCP Gateway connectivity to all registered services and environments
- **Diagnostic Result Analysis**: Analysis and categorization of diagnostic results with actionable recommendation generation
- **Real-Time Diagnostic Operations**: On-demand diagnostic execution without persistent storage, optimized for immediate analysis

**What This Domain Does NOT Own (Explicit Exclusions):**
- **Environment Registry Data**: Owned by Environment Registry domain - we consume environment targets and update health status
- **Tool Classification**: Owned by Tool Management domain - we use tool categorization for diagnostic coverage determination
- **Service Configuration**: We test connectivity and functionality but do not manage service configurations
- **Issue Resolution**: We provide diagnostic results and recommendations but do not implement automated fixes

**Boundary Violations to Avoid:**
- DO NOT modify environment registry data beyond health status updates
- DO NOT implement tool classification logic that duplicates Tool Management domain
- DO NOT create service configuration management functionality outside Environment Registry domain

### **Ubiquitous Language**

| Domain Term | Business Definition | Code Representation | Usage Rules |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Diagnostic Framework | Comprehensive system for validating MCP Gateway and environment health | `DiagnosticFramework` domain service | Orchestrates all diagnostic operations across environments and services |
| Diagnostic Execution | Process of running connectivity and functionality tests against environments | `DiagnosticExecutionEngine` class | Executes tests with timeout handling and result aggregation |
| System Health Validation | Comprehensive validation of all system components and environment connectivity | `SystemHealthValidator` domain service | Validates connectivity, functionality, and performance across all components |
| Actionable Diagnostic Result | Diagnostic outcome with specific remediation recommendations | `ActionableDiagnosticResult` value object | Contains structured error information with resolution guidance |

**Language Consistency Rules:**
- All code classes/methods MUST use exact business terminology from this table
- Tests MUST use business language: "should validate TimescaleDB connectivity in development environment"
- API endpoints MUST reflect business operations: `/diagnostics/validate-system-health` not `/diagnostics/run-tests`
- Database table/column names MUST match domain terms: `diagnostic_execution_results`, `system_health_validation`
- Cross-team communication MUST use these exact terms when discussing diagnostic operations

**Terms to Avoid (Anti-Patterns):**
- "Test Runner" instead of "Diagnostic Execution"
- "Health Checker" instead of "System Health Validation"
- Generic terms like "Validator", "Monitor", "Scanner" for diagnostic-specific concepts
- Technical jargon that business stakeholders don't understand

### **Context Map Integration**

| Related Domain | DDD Relationship | Integration Pattern | Dependency Direction | Reference Document |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Environment Registry | **Customer/Supplier** | API/Event | We depend on them for environment targets | environment-registry.domain.req.md |
| Tool Management | **Customer/Supplier** | API | We depend on them for tool classification | tool-management.domain.req.md |
| Existing Self-Diagnostics | **Replacement** | Migration | We replace existing diagnostic functionality | (existing limited diagnostics) |
| Claude Code Workflows | **Supplier/Customer** | Result API | They depend on us for diagnostic results | (external integration) |

**DDD Relationship Definitions:**
- **Customer/Supplier**: We consume environment data from Environment Registry and tool data from Tool Management
- **Replacement**: We replace existing limited self-diagnostics with comprehensive framework
- **Supplier/Customer**: We provide diagnostic results to Claude Code for automated analysis and resolution

**Integration Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Direct access to environment configuration bypassing Environment Registry
- Implementing tool classification logic outside Tool Management domain
- Creating persistent diagnostic data storage that conflicts with real-time requirements
