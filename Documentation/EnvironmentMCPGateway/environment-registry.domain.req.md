## **CAPABILITY REGISTRY MAINTENANCE**

**Registry Update Requirements:**
When creating this domain document, the AI MUST:

**During Document Creation:**
1. Generate unique capability ID: MCPGATEWAY-ENVREGISTRY-ae7f
2. Check `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/capability-registry.md` for conflicts
3. ADD new capability entry to registry with:
   - Status: "Not Started"
   - Created Date: 2025-09-06
   - Implementation ICP: "TBD"
   - Document: environment-registry.domain.req.md

**During Feature Updates:**
When ICPs implement features from this domain:
1. Update feature status in this document's feature table
2. Update "Implementation ICP" column with actual ICP reference
3. Update "Completed Date" when feature implementation finishes

**Registry Interaction Pattern:**
- **CREATE** new capability entry when this document is first created
- **REFERENCE** this capability ID in all future ICPs and cross-references
- **MAINTAIN** feature status alignment between this document and registry

## **CAPABILITY OVERVIEW**
The Environment Registry capability provides centralized management of multiple application environments through a hierarchical registry system that maintains application-environment-server relationships with associated service configurations and health monitoring. This capability transforms the EnvironmentMCPGateway from a localhost-focused tool into an enterprise-scale multi-environment management platform capable of routing environment-aware tools to appropriate targets while maintaining environment isolation and providing comprehensive service discovery.

The capability enables development teams to register and manage multiple environments (development, QA, production) for multiple applications from a single MCP Gateway location, automatically discover services within each environment, and maintain real-time health status of all registered environments. The system provides intelligent routing for environment-aware MCP tools while preserving backward compatibility for environment-agnostic operations.

**Core Business Responsibility:** Centralized registry and service discovery system that enables enterprise-scale multi-environment management through the MCP Gateway platform.

**Business Value Delivered:**
- **Operational Centralization**: Single point of management for all application environments, reducing operational overhead and configuration complexity
- **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between development, QA, and production environments with proper access controls and configuration management
- **Service Discovery Automation**: Automated detection and validation of environment services, eliminating manual configuration and reducing environment setup errors

## **DOMAIN BOUNDARIES AND CONTEXT**

### **Bounded Context Definition**
**Domain Boundaries (Critical DDD Principle):**
Define clear ownership to prevent model corruption and maintain domain autonomy.

**What This Domain Owns (Complete Responsibility):**
- **Application Registry**: Complete lifecycle management of registered applications and their environment configurations with validation rules and persistence
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific service configurations, connection parameters, and authentication credentials with secure storage and access patterns
- **Service Discovery**: Automated detection and validation of services within registered environments including health monitoring and connectivity testing
- **Environment Health Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of environment service status, connectivity validation, and health reporting with alerting capabilities

**What This Domain Does NOT Own (Explicit Exclusions):**
- **MCP Tool Definitions**: Owned by Tool Management domain - we provide environment context for tool routing
- **Session Management**: Owned by existing Session Management - we integrate with existing session architecture
- **Transport Protocol**: Owned by existing Transport layer - we use existing HTTP/SSE transport for client communication
- **Authentication Services**: We store and manage environment credentials but do not implement authentication protocols

**Boundary Violations to Avoid:**
- DO NOT directly modify MCP tool definitions or routing logic beyond environment context provision
- DO NOT implement session management functionality that bypasses existing session architecture
- DO NOT create custom transport mechanisms that bypass existing HTTP transport layer

### **Ubiquitous Language**

| Domain Term | Business Definition | Code Representation | Usage Rules |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Application Registry | Central repository of applications and their environments | `ApplicationRegistry` class | Used by: Environment management, tool routing. Contains hierarchical app-env-server relationships |
| Environment Configuration | Complete service and connection configuration for an environment | `EnvironmentConfiguration` record | Immutable once validated, contains service endpoints and authentication |
| Service Discovery | Process of detecting and validating services within an environment | `IServiceDiscoveryEngine` interface | Stateless operation, returns discovery results with health status |
| Environment Health | Current connectivity and service status for an environment | `EnvironmentHealthStatus` value object | Real-time status, updated by background monitoring processes |

**Language Consistency Rules:**
- All code classes/methods MUST use exact business terminology from this table
- Tests MUST use business language: "should discover TimescaleDB service in development environment"
- API endpoints MUST reflect business operations: `/environment-registry/register-application` not `/environments/create`
- Database table/column names MUST match domain terms: `application_registry`, `environment_configuration`
- Cross-team communication MUST use these exact terms when discussing environment management

**Terms to Avoid (Anti-Patterns):**
- "Configuration Manager" instead of "Environment Configuration"
- "Service Scanner" instead of "Service Discovery"
- Generic terms like "Data", "Info", "Handler" for environment concepts
- CRUD terminology instead of business operations: "create environment" vs "register environment"

### **Context Map Integration**

| Related Domain | DDD Relationship | Integration Pattern | Dependency Direction | Reference Document |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Tool Management | **Supplier/Customer** | API/Event | They depend on us for environment context | tool-management.domain.req.md |
| Diagnostics Framework | **Supplier/Customer** | API/Event | They depend on us for environment data | diagnostics-framework.domain.req.md |
| Session Management | **Conformist** | Existing API | We adapt to existing session architecture | (existing architecture) |
| Transport Layer | **Conformist** | HTTP/SSE API | We use existing transport without modification | (existing architecture) |

**DDD Relationship Definitions:**
- **Supplier/Customer**: We provide environment registry services to Tool Management and Diagnostics domains
- **Conformist**: We accept existing Session and Transport architectures as-is to maintain system integration

**Integration Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Direct database access from Tool Management or Diagnostics domains
- Bypassing environment registry API for environment data access
- Creating separate environment configuration storage outside this domain
