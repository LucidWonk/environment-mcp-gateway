  Scenario: Complete solution build validation across all languages
    Given C# solution with Directory.Packages.props and TypeScript EnvironmentMCPGateway project
    When executing unified build command with lint and test validation
    Then all C# projects should compile successfully with zero warnings
    And TypeScript project should pass ESLint validation and Jest testing
    And complete validation should complete within acceptable timeframes

Feature: Docker Containerization and Orchestration
  Scenario: Infrastructure service orchestration with health monitoring
    Given docker-compose configuration for TimescaleDB and RedPanda services
    When executing docker-compose up with health check validation
    Then all infrastructure services should start successfully with health confirmation
    And application containers should build and deploy with proper networking
    And service monitoring should provide comprehensive operational visibility

Feature: Platform Component Standards Enforcement
  Scenario: Utility library usage validation across platform applications
    Given application code requiring logging, configuration, messaging, and DSL parsing
    When implementing functionality through established Utility library components
    Then logging should use exclusively Utility.Output.LoggerConfig Serilog configuration
    And configuration access should occur through Utility.Configuration.EnvironmentManager
    And messaging should utilize Utility.Messaging.RedPandaWrapper patterns
