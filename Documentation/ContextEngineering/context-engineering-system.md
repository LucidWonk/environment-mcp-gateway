# Context Engineering System Overview

**Version**: 5.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Active

## **System Purpose**

The Context Engineering System is a comprehensive AI-powered development assistance framework that autonomously maintains accurate, semantically-rich contextual information throughout the software development lifecycle. It enables AI systems like Claude Code to provide domain-aware, business-intelligent assistance by automatically curating and updating context based on code changes, requirements evolution, and architectural decisions.

## **Three-Tier Instruction Architecture (v5.0)**

The Context Engineering System v5.0 establishes a clear instruction hierarchy to eliminate conflicts and leverage Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following capabilities:

### **Tier 1: Templates (Execution Authority)**
- **Purpose**: Imperative execution instructions
- **Content**: Complete, self-contained execution steps
- **Authority**: Highest - templates have final say on "how" to execute
- **Location**: `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/`
- **Who Uses**: AI executing ICPs

### **Tier 2: Kickstarter (Workflow Reference)**
- **Purpose**: Workflow patterns and decision trees
- **Content**: Template selection logic, process guidance
- **Authority**: Medium - provides "when" and "which" guidance
- **Location**: `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Kickstarters/`
- **Who Uses**: AI choosing which template to use

### **Tier 3: System Overview (Conceptual Context)**
- **Purpose**: Philosophy, principles, and "why" explanations
- **Content**: Conceptual understanding, architecture, purpose
- **Authority**: Foundational - explains "why" but doesn't prescribe "how"
- **Location**: This document
- **Who Uses**: Humans and AI seeking to understand the system

### **Escalation Path**
When AI needs context beyond template instructions:
1. **First**: Check relevant template (execution details)
2. **Second**: Check kickstarter (workflow guidance)
3. **Third**: Check system overview (conceptual understanding)
4. **Last**: Ask human for clarification

## **Key Terminology**

### **Requirements (req)**
**Definition**: Complete, absolute specifications that define what must exist in the system.

Requirements documents specify the complete specifications of capabilities, business rules, and system behaviors in absolute terms rather than relative changes or deltas. They define what will be built with sufficient detail - not just "add feature X" or "modify component Y" but the full specification of what the final system should contain and how it should behave. This absolute specification approach provides AI systems with comprehensive context about what to implement, reducing ambiguity while allowing for reasonable interpretation and implementation decisions.

### **Incremental Change Prompt (ICP)**
**Definition**: Structured AI protocols that break complex work into manageable, sequential steps with validation gates.

ICPs are named "Incremental Change Prompt" because they guide AI systems through incremental, step-by-step execution of complex tasks rather than attempting everything at once. Each ICP defines a series of small, verifiable changes that build toward the complete requirements specification. This incremental approach ensures quality, enables human oversight at each step, and reduces the risk of large-scale failures. The "prompt" aspect refers to the structured instructions that guide AI execution through each incremental step.

**ICP Types**:
- **Codification ICP**: Incrementally systematize concepts into clear specifications
- **Implementation ICP**: Incrementally build working code from systematized specifications

## **DOCUMENT CREATION DECISION MATRIX**

### **When to Create Documentation**

**CREATE domain.req.md when:**
- Backend business logic with domain rules
- Infrastructure components requiring configuration  
- Service interfaces with integration patterns
- Libraries with reusable business capabilities
- **Example**: `fractal-analysis.domain.req.md`, `messaging-infrastructure.domain.req.md`

**CREATE digital.req.md when:**
- Web interfaces, dashboards, or visual components
- API endpoints with user-facing responses  
- Management consoles or admin interfaces
- Developer tools with UI components
- **Example**: `trading-dashboard.digital.req.md`, `system-admin-console.digital.req.md`

**CREATE BOTH domain.req.md AND digital.req.md when:**
- Full-stack features with both backend logic AND user interfaces
- **Example**: Trading System
  - `trading-engine.domain.req.md` (order processing, risk management, business rules)
  - `trading-interface.digital.req.md` (trader dashboard, charts, controls)

**DON'T CREATE documentation when:**
- Simple utilities with no business logic
- Generated/build artifacts  
- Third-party integrations (document patterns instead)
- Experimental/unstable code
- Pure operational scripts

### **Hybrid Organization Structure**
Documentation follows: `/Documentation/<Project>/<DDD-Concepts>/`
- **Example**: `/Documentation/Utility/Analysis/fractal-analysis.domain.req.md`
- **Rationale**: Maintains physical-logical mapping while supporting domain-driven organization

### **Information Flow Architecture**

**Document Lifecycle:**
```
NewConcepts Exploration → Concept ICP → Implementation ICP → Code Implementation → Document Lifecycle Completion → Mature Documents
```

**Context Engineering Flow:**
```
Code Changes → Semantic Analysis → Cross-Domain Impact → Holistic Context Regeneration → AI Context Enhancement
```

**Registry Lifecycle:**
```
Placeholder IDs → Domain Discovery → Human Approval → Final Capability Registration → Status Tracking
```

## **Document Lifecycle Management**

### **Phase 1: Concept Exploration (NewConcepts)**

**Purpose**: Support exploration of concepts whose domain boundaries are unclear.

**Location**: `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/NewConcepts/`
**Templates**: `template.concept.req.md`
**Registry Strategy**: Placeholder IDs (`TEMP-[DOMAIN]-[NAME]-####`) - no registration to avoid cleanup complexity

**Key Principles:**
- Concepts start with unclear domain boundaries
- Use placeholder capability IDs to avoid registry pollution
- Focus on business value exploration over technical precision
- Expect domain boundaries to evolve during implementation

#### **Feature 4: Document Lifecycle Automation**
**Implementation Status**: ❌ Not Implemented (Implementation ICP: Phase 4 Generation)

   - Updates cross-references across all documentation

2. **Implementation Artifact Archival** (Step N+1.2):
   - Archives implementation ICP with timestamp (for NewConcepts)
   - Updates archival index with implementation metrics
   - Validates complete implementation lifecycle integrity

### **Phase 6: Document Maturation**

**Purpose**: Convert NewConcepts to mature domain documents after implementation.

**Enhanced Process** (Building on Phase 5 completion):
1. **Domain Discovery**: Identify actual domain boundaries discovered during implementation (done in Phase 5)
2. **Human Approval**: Present restructuring proposal for approval (done in Phase 5)
3. **Document Migration**: Create mature documents using template.domain.req.md or template.digital.req.md (done in Phase 5)
