# ICP-CONCEPT: MCP HTTP Transport Implementation - Multi-Client Server Architecture

## **CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

This codification ICP provides comprehensive specifications for migrating the EnvironmentMCPGateway from STDIO transport to HTTP/SSE transport, enabling multi-client access through detailed architectural planning. This consolidates and enhances the previous multi-client concept work, focusing on complete specification of the HTTP transport architecture, session management patterns, and collaborative workflow coordination.

The specifications address the critical gap where comprehensive HTTP transport architecture needs detailed codification before implementation. The current server code uses StdioServerTransport, preventing multiple Claude Code instances from connecting simultaneously. This ICP provides complete architectural specifications for SSEServerTransport migration, client configuration patterns, and enhanced Context Engineering documentation for collaborative workflows.

**CRITICAL PROCESS COMPLIANCE**: This ICP provides ONLY specifications and architectural planning. All actual implementation work will be performed in a separate implementation.icp.md that references these specifications.

## **CAPABILITY REGISTRY MAINTENANCE**

**Registry Update Requirements:**
This implementation ICP transitions from NewConcept placeholder IDs to actual capability implementation and registration.

### **Implementation ICP Registry Approach:**
**IMPORTANT**: This ICP implements capabilities that will be registered upon completion.

**During Implementation:**
1. **REFERENCE** placeholder ID from concept: TEMP-CONTEXT-MCP-HTTP-TRANSPORT-ht23
2. **PREPARE** final capability IDs for registry addition upon completion
3. **VALIDATE** implementation against capability specifications
4. **REGISTER** completed capabilities in capability-registry.md

**Post-Implementation Registry Updates:**
1. **ADD** new HTTP transport capability to Infrastructure domain
2. **UPDATE** existing EnvironmentMCPGateway capability with multi-client support
3. **CROSS-REFERENCE** Context Engineering capabilities with multi-client patterns
4. **VALIDATE** registry consistency across all related capabilities

**Registry Interaction Pattern:**
- **Implementation Phase**: Use placeholder IDs, prepare final registrations
- **Completion Phase**: Register implemented capabilities, update cross-references
- **MAINTAIN** registry as authoritative source for completed implementations

## **CURRENT ARCHITECTURAL STATE**

**Technical Gap Analysis:**
The EnvironmentMCPGateway codebase contains comprehensive MCP tool implementations but lacks the HTTP transport layer that was documented in architectural planning. Current server.ts uses StdioServerTransport which fundamentally prevents concurrent client connections.

**Code Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **MCP Tools**: 43 tools fully implemented and functional
- ✅ **Server Infrastructure**: Comprehensive server architecture with health monitoring
- ❌ **HTTP Transport**: StdioServerTransport prevents multi-client access
- ❌ **Session Management**: No multi-client session coordination
- ❌ **Configuration**: Client configurations still reference Docker STDIO exec

**Documentation Implementation Gap:**
- ✅ **Architectural Documentation**: Comprehensive HTTP transport architecture documented
- ✅ **Tool Documentation**: All 43 MCP tools documented
- ❌ **Implementation Specifications**: Lack concrete implementation steps
- ❌ **Multi-Client Workflows**: Context Engineering documentation assumes single-client
- ❌ **Configuration Examples**: No HTTP transport configuration examples

**Existing Implementation to Analyze:**
The AI MUST review these implementation files to understand current state:

**Server Implementation Files:**
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/src/server.ts` - Current STDIO transport implementation
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/src/health-server.ts` - Existing HTTP health server infrastructure
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/package.json` - MCP SDK dependencies and versions
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/docker/Dockerfile.multistage` - Container architecture

**Configuration Files:**
- `.mcp.json` - Current STDIO Docker exec configuration
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/mcp-server-config.json` - MCP server configuration
- `EnvironmentMCPGateway/claude_desktop_config.json` - Claude Code configuration

**Context Engineering Documentation:**
- `Documentation/ContextEngineering/Kickstarters/context-engineering-kickstarter.md` - Current single-client workflow documentation

## **ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATIONS**

**CODIFICATION ICP SCOPE**: This section provides detailed architectural specifications and technical requirements for HTTP transport migration. These specifications will be used to create a separate implementation.icp.md that performs the actual code changes.

**FOLLOW-UP WORK**: Upon approval of these specifications, a separate `mcp-http-transport-implementation.implementation.icp.md` will be created to execute the actual transport migration and system changes described here.

### **Phase 1: Server Transport Architecture Specifications**

#### **Server Architecture Changes**
**File**: `EnvironmentMCPGateway/src/server.ts`

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

// Current single-client transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await this.server.connect(transport);
```

**Target Implementation:**
```typescript
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';
import http from 'http';

// Multi-client HTTP/SSE transport
const httpServer = http.createServer();
const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/mcp', httpServer);
await this.server.connect(transport);

// Start HTTP server with MCP and health endpoints
httpServer.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    logger.info(`MCP server listening on http://0.0.0.0:${port}/mcp`);
});
```

**Specification Requirements:**
- [ ] Replace StdioServerTransport import with SSEServerTransport
- [ ] Create HTTP server instance for SSE transport
- [ ] Configure MCP endpoint path (/mcp) for SSE transport
- [ ] Integrate with existing health server or create unified HTTP server
- [ ] Maintain all 43 existing MCP tools without functional changes
- [ ] Preserve existing logging and error handling patterns
- [ ] Add multi-client session tracking and management

**Session Management Specifications:**
```typescript
interface ClientSession {
    id: string;
    connectedAt: Date;
    lastActivity: Date;
    userAgent?: string;
}

class SessionManager {
    private sessions = new Map<string, ClientSession>();
    
    addSession(sessionId: string): void {
        this.sessions.set(sessionId, {
            id: sessionId,
            connectedAt: new Date(),
            lastActivity: new Date()
        });
    }
    
    removeSession(sessionId: string): void {
        this.sessions.delete(sessionId);
    }
    
    getActiveSessions(): ClientSession[] {
        return Array.from(this.sessions.values());
    }
}
```

#### **HTTP Server Integration**
**Integration with Existing Health Server:**
The current HealthServer class in `src/health-server.ts` provides HTTP infrastructure. The implementation must integrate MCP SSE transport with existing health endpoints to create a unified HTTP server.

**Unified HTTP Server Architecture:**
```typescript
class UnifiedHTTPServer {
    private httpServer: http.Server;
    private mcpTransport: SSEServerTransport;
    private sessionManager: SessionManager;
    
    constructor(port: number) {
        this.httpServer = this.createUnifiedServer();
        this.mcpTransport = new SSEServerTransport('/mcp', this.httpServer);
        this.sessionManager = new SessionManager();
    }
    
    private createUnifiedServer(): http.Server {
        return http.createServer((req, res) => {
            // Handle health endpoints
            if (req.url?.startsWith('/health') || req.url?.startsWith('/status')) {
                return this.handleHealthEndpoints(req, res);
            }
            
            // SSE transport handles /mcp endpoints automatically
            // Other routes return 404
            res.writeHead(404);
            res.end('Not Found');
        });
    }
}
```

    CMD curl -f http://localhost:3001/health || exit 1
```

**Docker Compose Integration:**
```yaml
services:
  environment-mcp-gateway:
    build: ./EnvironmentMCPGateway
