## **CAPABILITY REGISTRY INTERACTION (NewConcepts)**
**IMPORTANT**: NewConcepts use placeholder IDs to avoid registry pollution.

**During NewConcepts Phase:**
1. Generate placeholder ID: TEMP-CONTEXT-MCP-HTTP-TRANSPORT-ht23
2. Do NOT add to capability-registry.md
3. Note: Final IDs will be generated during implementation

**After Implementation:**
1. AI will propose final capability IDs and registry entries
2. Human approves domain placement and final IDs
3. Mature documents use standard registry interaction patterns

**Registry Interaction Pattern:**
- **PLACEHOLDER ONLY** during concept phase
- **AVOID REGISTRATION** to prevent cleanup complexity
- **FINAL REGISTRATION** happens during implementation completion

## **CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

The MCP HTTP Transport Implementation concept addresses a critical architectural gap where the EnvironmentMCPGateway was planned but never actually implemented with HTTP transport capabilities. While comprehensive documentation exists in the mcp-multi-client-http-transport.codification.icp.md file, the actual server implementation remains on STDIO transport, preventing multiple Claude Code instances from connecting simultaneously.

This concept bridges the gap between documented architectural intent and current implementation reality. The existing server.ts uses `StdioServerTransport` which only supports single-client connections through Docker STDIO exec, while Claude Code now expects HTTP endpoints for multi-client scenarios. The implementation involves migrating from STDIO to `SSEServerTransport` (Server-Sent Events over HTTP) while preserving all 43 existing MCP tools and maintaining backward compatibility.

The concept encompasses three critical integration points:
1. **Server Architecture Update**: Replace StdioServerTransport with SSEServerTransport in EnvironmentMCPGateway
2. **Configuration Migration**: Update Claude Code configuration files (.mcp.json) from Docker exec STDIO to HTTP endpoint connections
3. **Context Engineering Documentation**: Update context-engineering-kickstarter.md and related documentation to reflect multi-client workflow patterns and collaborative development scenarios

This concept evolved from discovering that while extensive planning was done (as evidenced in the ICP documentation), the actual implementation was marked "Not Implemented" and never completed, leaving users unable to connect multiple Claude Code instances to the comprehensive MCP tool suite.

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Current State Analysis**
**Architecture Limitation**: EnvironmentMCPGateway uses StdioServerTransport which fundamentally prevents concurrent client connections
**Configuration Mismatch**: Claude Code expects HTTP endpoints but server provides only STDIO through Docker exec
**Documentation Gap**: Context Engineering documentation assumes single-client workflows, lacking multi-client collaboration patterns
**User Impact**: Developers cannot use multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously, limiting collaborative development workflows

### **Root Cause Assessment**
The core issue stems from an architectural planning vs implementation disconnect:
- **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive HTTP transport architecture was documented in ICP format
- **Implementation Phase**: Server code was never updated from STDIO to HTTP transport
- **Configuration Phase**: Client configuration files still reference Docker STDIO exec patterns
- **Documentation Phase**: Context Engineering workflows assume single-client architecture

### **Business Impact**
- **Development Velocity**: Single-client limitation reduces team productivity and collaborative development
- **Tool Accessibility**: 43 comprehensive MCP tools (Context Engineering, Infrastructure Management, Git Workflow, Azure DevOps) remain single-user
- **Architecture Debt**: Growing gap between documented intent and actual implementation
- **User Experience**: Failed connections and "Failed to reconnect to environment-gateway" errors

## **PROPOSED SOLUTION APPROACH**

### **Implementation Strategy**
**Phase 1: Server Transport Migration**
- Replace `StdioServerTransport` with `SSEServerTransport` in EnvironmentMCPGateway/src/server.ts
- Implement HTTP endpoint configuration and port management
- Maintain existing health server alongside MCP server HTTP transport
- Preserve all 43 existing MCP tools with zero functional regression

**Phase 2: Configuration Update**
- Update .mcp.json files to use HTTP endpoints instead of Docker exec STDIO
- Implement transport selection logic for backward compatibility
- Configure Claude Code for HTTP endpoint discovery and connection
- Test multi-client connection scenarios

**Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement**
- Update Context Engineering documentation for multi-client workflows
- Document collaborative development patterns with approval gate preservation
- Specify concurrent access patterns for Context Engineering tools
- Update MCP tool documentation for multi-session scenarios

### **Technical Architecture**

**Transport Layer Changes:**
```typescript
// Current (STDIO - Single Client)
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await this.server.connect(transport);

// Proposed (HTTP/SSE - Multi Client)
const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/mcp', port);
await this.server.connect(transport);
```

**Configuration Migration:**
```json
// Current (.mcp.json - STDIO)
{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["exec", "-i", "environment-mcp-gateway", "node", "dist/server.js"]
}

// Proposed (.mcp.json - HTTP)
{
  "transport": "http",
  "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
}
```

### **Integration Requirements**

**Context Engineering System Integration:**
- **Approval Gates**: Preserve human approval requirements in multi-client scenarios

### **Integration with Existing Context Engineering System**

**Approval Gate Preservation:**
The HTTP transport implementation must preserve the critical human approval gates that are fundamental to the Context Engineering system. Multi-client access cannot bypass or compromise the human oversight requirements for Context Engineering operations.

**Holistic Update Coordination:**
Context Engineering holistic updates (cross-domain context modifications) require special coordination in multi-client scenarios. The implementation must ensure that holistic updates are properly coordinated across all active sessions to maintain context integrity.

**Tool Access Patterns:**
The 43 MCP tools must be enhanced to support concurrent access while maintaining data consistency and avoiding conflicts. This includes proper session isolation for client-specific operations and shared resource coordination for collaborative operations.
