2. capability-registry.md eliminated (tracking moves to req files)
3. Version history updated across all templates

**Registry Interaction Pattern:**
- **PLACEHOLDER ONLY** during concept phase
- **NO REGISTRATION** (system docs track their own versions)
- **VERSION UPDATES** happen during implementation completion

## **CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

The Context Engineering System v5.0 represents a comprehensive redesign to leverage Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following capabilities while addressing critical pain points discovered through real-world usage of v4.0. The current system was designed for earlier Sonnet versions (4.0/4.1) which struggled with complex nested instructions, competing guidance sources, and maintaining state across context window rollovers.

**Important Context**: This upgrade is being developed in the `lucidwonks-mcp-gateway` repository, which is now the official home of the Context Engineering System. The HTTP/SSE transport layer has been successfully implemented (✅ Active at `http://localhost:3001/mcp`), enabling multi-client Claude Code access. This v5.0 upgrade builds on that foundation to optimize the workflow for Sonnet 4.5.

**Core Business Purpose:** Transform the Context Engineering System from a complex, fragile process into a simple, resilient workflow that Sonnet 4.5 can execute reliably while maintaining strong human oversight and control.

**Potential Business Value:**
- **Reliability**: 90%+ reduction in workflow violations (skipped tests, ignored stop gates, lost context)
- **Efficiency**: 40%+ faster execution through clearer instructions and reduced ambiguity
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for each instruction type eliminates conflicting guidance
- **Scalability**: Context rollover resilience enables longer, more complex implementations
- **Quality**: Mandatory self-validation checkpoints ensure consistent output quality

**Exploration Questions:**
- Can we eliminate the capability-registry.md without losing tracking capability?
- Will bunker-style stop gates actually prevent Sonnet from continuing execution?
- Does the 3x3 block structure provide sufficient granularity for complex implementations?
- Can state persistence blocks survive context rollovers effectively?
- Are tool restrictions enforceable in codification vs implementation phases?

## **CONCEPT BOUNDARIES (Exploratory)**

**IMPORTANT**: These boundaries span the entire Context Engineering System infrastructure.

### **Potential Domain Ownership**
**What This Concept Owns:**
- Three-tier instruction architecture (templates, kickstarter, system overview)
- All template file structures and versioning
- Execution workflow patterns (concept → codification → implementation)
- Stop gate enforcement mechanisms
- State tracking and context rollover protocols
- Capability tracking methodology (decentralized to req files)
- Self-validation framework
- Phase separation rules (codification vs implementation)

**What This Concept Does NOT Own:**
- Actual business domain requirements (those live in domain.req.md files)
- Digital/UI specifications (those live in digital.req.md files)
- Virtual Expert Team system (separate capability)
- MCP Gateway infrastructure
- Git workflow processes
- Testing frameworks (Reqnroll, XUnit)

**Boundary Uncertainty:**
- Interaction between template versioning and individual document versioning
- How aggressively to enforce tool restrictions in different phases
- Balance between self-validation checkpoints and execution speed
- Degree of prescription in execution block structures

### **Feature Detailed Exploration**

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F001**
**Name**: Three-Tier Instruction Architecture
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Establishes clear instruction hierarchy eliminating conflicts between system overview, kickstarter, and templates. Current v4.0 has competing instructions across 9 documents causing AI confusion. This feature creates strict separation: Templates = execution authority, Kickstarter = workflow reference, System Overview = conceptual context.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will this hierarchy eliminate instruction conflicts? (Yes - clear precedence rules)
- ✅ Can Sonnet 4.5 follow this hierarchy reliably? (Yes - enhanced instruction-following)
- ✅ Does this simplify or complicate the system? (Simplifies - single source per instruction type)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Restructure context-engineering-system.md to remove execution details (keep only conceptual content)
- Restructure context-engineering-kickstarter.md to add decision trees and workflow patterns
- Restructure all templates to contain complete execution instructions (no references needed)
- Add explicit hierarchy rules to each document type
- Update all cross-references to respect tier boundaries

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: All subsequent features depend on this foundation
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Tier 1 (Templates)**: Imperative execution instructions, validation checklists, stop gates
- **Tier 2 (Kickstarter)**: Decision trees, workflow patterns, template selection logic
- **Tier 3 (System)**: Philosophy, principles, lifecycle concepts, "why" explanations

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Straightforward restructuring of existing content
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Improves existing functionality without breaking changes
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained within Context Engineering docs

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] Zero instruction conflicts between documents after restructuring
- [x] AI can execute from templates without referencing other docs
- [x] Clear escalation path (template → kickstarter → system) when AI needs context

**Implementation Notes:**
This is the foundational feature. All other features build on this clear separation. Must complete first.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F002**
**Name**: Bunker-Style Stop Gates
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Replaces weak stop gates that are sometimes ignored with visually-reinforced barriers that Sonnet 4.5 cannot miss. Current v4.0 stop gates have "helpful context" after them that tempts AI to continue. New bunker style uses box-drawing characters, explicit state declaration, clear prohibited actions, and **zero content after the gate**.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will visual barriers be more effective than text-only gates? (Yes - psychological "wall" effect)
- ✅ Does Sonnet 4.5 respect no-content-after-gate rule? (Should test, but strong precedent suggests yes)
- ✅ Will this slow down execution too much? (No - gates only at critical decision points)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Create standardized bunker-style stop gate template pattern
- Replace all existing stop gates in templates
- Add state declaration to each stop gate
- Add explicit prohibited actions lists
- Remove all post-gate content (no helpful tips, no guidance)
- Update kickstarter with stop gate protocol

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates must have execution authority)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Visual Barrier**: ═══ box-drawing characters create psychological boundary
- **State Declaration**: Current phase/step/subtask/status explicitly shown
- **Prohibited Actions**: ❌ marked list of what NOT to do
- **Approval Mechanism**: Single simple instruction (e.g., "TYPE 'continue' TO PROCEED")
- **Zero Post-Gate Content**: Nothing after approval instruction (prevents temptation to continue)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Pure formatting change
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Improves compliance with existing process
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained formatting pattern

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 0% stop gate violations in test executions (vs ~20% in v4.0)
- [x] Clear visual distinction between active execution and stopped state
- [x] User can immediately identify what approval is needed

**Implementation Notes:**
Template pattern should be reusable across all ICP types. Consider creating a snippet/macro for consistency.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F003**
**Name**: State Persistence Blocks
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Solves context window rollover problem where AI loses track of execution position. Current v4.0 has no resilience mechanism. New approach: every ICP document has live state block at top showing current phase/step/block, completed work, current focus, remaining work, last action, and next action. AI reads this first after rollover to instantly re-orient.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will AI remember to update state block after each subtask? (Make it mandatory in execution checklist)
- ✅ Can state block provide enough context after rollover? (Yes - combined with F007 rollover protocol)
- ✅ Will this create maintenance overhead? (Minimal - update is single checklist item per block)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Create standardized state persistence block template
- Add state block to top of all ICP templates
- Add "update state block" as mandatory task in each execution block
- Define state fields: ICP Type, Phase, Step, Block, Status, Completed, Current Focus, Remaining, Last Action, Next Action
- Update kickstarter with state block maintenance protocol
- Add state block to F007 rollover protocol

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates), F004 (3x3 block structure for granular state tracking)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **State Fields**: ICP Type, Phase (N of M), Step (N.N of N.N), Block (N of 3), Status (in_progress/awaiting_approval/completed)
- **Progress Tracking**: Completed (✅ checklist), Current Focus (🔵), Remaining (⬜)
- **Action Context**: Last Action (what just happened), Next Action (what's next)
- **Update Frequency**: After each execution block completion
- **Visual Format**: Box-drawing bordered block for prominence

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Simple markdown formatting
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Pure addition, no existing functionality affected
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained within ICP documents

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] AI can resume execution after context rollover with 100% accuracy
- [x] User can see execution progress at a glance
- [x] State block updates happen automatically as part of execution flow

**Implementation Notes:**
Critical for long-running implementations. Must be visually prominent (top of document) and mandatory to update.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F004**
**Name**: 3x3 Execution Block Structure
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Simplifies current 9-subtask (A-I) structure which is hard to remember and track. New structure: 3 blocks of 3 tasks each (Preparation, Execution, Finalization). Leverages human cognitive limit of 3±1 items. Easier for AI to track, easier for humans to review, maintains same granularity.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Does 3x3 provide sufficient granularity? (Yes - same 9 checkpoints, better organized)
- ✅ Will this reduce skipped subtasks? (Yes - clearer purpose grouping makes gaps obvious)
- ✅ Is this pattern flexible enough for all ICP types? (Yes - blocks can adapt to context)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Replace A-I subtask structure with Block 1-3 structure in all templates
- Define standard block purposes: Preparation (setup), Execution (actual work), Finalization (verification)
- Create 3-task checklist within each block
- Add self-validation checkpoint after each block (3 total vs 9 individual)
- Update kickstarter with block structure explanation
- Integrate with F003 state tracking (track current block)

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates), F003 (state tracking needs block granularity)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Block 1 (Preparation)**: Read requirements, identify decisions, update state
- **Block 2 (Execution)**: Actual implementation work, main deliverables
- **Block 3 (Finalization)**: Validate, cross-reference, update tracking
- **Block Checklist**: 3 checkbox items per block
- **Block Validation**: Self-validation checkpoint after each block
- **Visual Format**: Box-bordered blocks with clear purpose labels

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Reorganization of existing structure
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Maintains same coverage, better UX
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Medium - Requires updating all existing ICPs if they're active

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 0% subtask skipping (vs current issues with skipping D, E, F)
- [x] Faster execution (clearer structure reduces cognitive load)
- [x] Better user visibility into progress (3 block progress vs 9 letter progress)

**Implementation Notes:**
Standard block structure should be defined in templates. Individual steps can adapt block contents to context.

---

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F005**
**Name**: Self-Validation Framework
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Addresses critical issue where AI skips testing (subtask D), validation (E), and documentation (F). Current v4.0 relies on implicit instructions. New approach: Sonnet 4.5 explicitly validates its own work at checkpoints with mandatory PASS/FAIL assessment. If FAIL, must identify gaps and complete before proceeding. Creates audit trail of self-monitoring.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will AI actually fail its own validation? (Yes - if checklist items are specific and verifiable)
- ✅ How often should validation happen? (After each block - 3 times per step)
- ✅ What happens if AI marks PASS but work is incomplete? (Human approval gates catch this)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Create self-validation checkpoint template
- Add checkpoint after each execution block (3 per step)
- Define validation categories: Block Checklist, Required Artifacts, Quality Gates
- Mandatory PASS/FAIL assessment with explicit reasoning
- If FAIL: must list missing items, complete them, re-validate
- Update templates with validation checkpoints
- Integrate with F004 block structure

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F004 (validates blocks), F001 (templates have authority)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Validation Checklist**: Block-specific completion criteria
- **Artifact Verification**: Required files/changes must exist
- **Quality Gates**: Build passes, tests pass, docs updated, standards met
- **Self-Assessment**: Explicit PASS/FAIL with reasoning
- **Failure Protocol**: Identify gaps → Complete → Re-validate loop
- **Audit Trail**: Validation results visible in execution history

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Structured checklists in markdown
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Pure quality improvement
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained validation logic

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 0% skipped validation steps (D, E, F currently problematic)
- [x] 100% of implementations have passing tests before proceeding
- [x] Clear audit trail showing AI validated its own work

**Implementation Notes:**
This is the "Context Engineering Compliance Agent" mentioned but never implemented. It's not a separate tool - it's self-validation checkpoints throughout execution.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F006**
**Name**: Phase-Specific Tool Restrictions
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Prevents common error where AI writes code during codification phase or modifies specs during implementation phase. Current v4.0 has vague guidance about phase scope. New approach: explicit ALLOWED and PROHIBITED tool lists for each phase. Codification can only touch *.req.md and *.icp.md files. Implementation can touch code but not req files (specs frozen).

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Can we technically enforce tool restrictions? (No automatic enforcement, but clear lists make violations obvious)
- ✅ What if valid edge case requires prohibited tool? (Stop and request human approval for exception)
- ✅ Will this slow down execution? (No - clarifies rather than restricts legitimate actions)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Create tool restriction templates for codification phase
- Create tool restriction templates for implementation phase
- Define ALLOWED tools per phase (✅ marked list)
- Define PROHIBITED tools per phase (❌ marked list)
- Add scope statements defining phase boundaries
- Add prerequisite checks (implementation requires approved codification)
- Update templates with restriction blocks
- Add exception protocol for edge cases

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates have enforcement authority)
- **External**: Claude Code tool availability

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Codification Phase Allowed**: Read, Edit/Write (*.req.md, *.icp.md only), Grep/Glob, Virtual Expert
- **Codification Phase Prohibited**: Edit/Write (code files), Bash (build/test/deploy), Docker, Database, Git commits
- **Implementation Phase Allowed**: All code/test editing, Bash, Docker, Database, Git
- **Implementation Phase Prohibited**: Edit (*.req.md, *.digital.req.md - specs frozen), Spec modifications
- **Exception Protocol**: Stop → Document reason → Request human approval → Get explicit permission

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Clear lists, manual compliance
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Prevents errors, doesn't restrict valid actions
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained within phase definitions

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 0% code changes during codification phase
- [x] 0% spec changes during implementation phase
- [x] Clear escalation path for edge cases requiring exceptions

**Implementation Notes:**
Cannot technically enforce (no API to disable tools), but clear visual lists make violations obvious to both AI and human reviewers.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F007**
**Name**: Context Rollover Protocol
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Provides systematic recovery mechanism when context window rolls over mid-execution. Current v4.0 has no protocol, leading to lost context and confused AI. New approach: Two-level protocol. Level 1 (always): read state block for instant re-orientation. Level 2 (when uncertain): full re-grounding by re-reading kickstarter and template. Explicit confidence check with STOP if LOW confidence.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ How will AI detect context rollover? (Token count indicators, conversation history gaps)
- ✅ When should full re-grounding trigger? (AI uncertainty/confusion, or explicit LOW confidence)
- ✅ Will this create too much overhead? (No - Level 1 is fast, Level 2 only when needed)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Add rollover detection section to all ICP templates
- Define two-level protocol (lightweight vs full re-grounding)
- Create re-grounding checklist (what to read, in what order)
- Add confidence assessment checkpoint (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Add STOP protocol for LOW confidence
- Integrate with F003 state blocks (Level 1 reads state)
- Update kickstarter with rollover guidance

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F003 (state blocks provide Level 1 re-orientation), F001 (templates define protocol)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Level 1 (Always)**: Read state block at top of ICP → Verify understanding → Proceed
- **Level 2 (When Uncertain)**: Read kickstarter → Read current template → Review state block → Assess confidence
- **Confidence Levels**: HIGH (proceed), MEDIUM (review recent actions then proceed), LOW (STOP and request help)
- **Rollover Triggers**: Token count high, conversation history gaps, AI confusion/uncertainty
- **Re-grounding Sequence**: Tier 2 (kickstarter) → Tier 1 (template) → State block → Confidence check

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Reading existing documents
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Pure resilience improvement
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained recovery protocol

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 100% successful resumption after context rollover (vs current unpredictable behavior)
- [x] Clear confidence assessment visible to user
- [x] Minimal overhead (Level 1 sufficient in most cases)

**Implementation Notes:**
This addresses your specific question about context rollover. Option C (Hybrid) selected: always read state block (lightweight), full re-grounding only when uncertain.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F008**
**Name**: Decentralized Capability Tracking
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Eliminates problematic capability-registry.md which "never works properly" (creator observation). Current v4.0 has central registry that gets out of sync with req files. New approach: each domain.req.md and digital.req.md tracks its own capabilities and features with status. Aligns with DDD bounded context principle (each domain owns its tracking). Includes simple decision tree for AI to execute at point of need.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will decentralization cause tracking fragmentation? (No - requirements already live in req files)
- ✅ How to get system-wide capability view? (Generate on demand from req files, not manually maintained)
- ✅ What about cross-domain capability relationships? (Still documented in integration points sections)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Remove capability-registry.md from Context Engineering system
- Update template.domain.req.md with capability tracking section
- Update template.digital.req.md with capability tracking section
- Define capability tracking format (ID, status, implementation date, coverage, features)
- Define feature tracking format (ID, status, tests, location)
- Create decision tree for when to add/update tracking
- Update kickstarter with decentralized tracking guidance
- Archive capability-registry.md with explanation of why it was eliminated

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates define new tracking structure)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Capability Section**: ID, Name, Status (Not Started/In Progress/Implemented), Date, Coverage (N/M features)
- **Feature Section**: ID, Name, Status, Tests (passing count), Location (file path)
- **Tracking Location**: Within the domain.req.md or digital.req.md file itself
- **Decision Tree**: NewConcepts (placeholder, no tracking) → Creating capability (add to req file) → Implementing (update status) → No action
- **System View**: Generate on-demand by scanning all req files (not manually maintained)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Simplification of existing approach
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Addresses known pain point
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Medium - Need to update any tools/scripts that reference registry

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] No capability-registry.md to maintain or get out of sync
- [x] Tracking colocated with specifications (single source of truth)
- [x] Clear decision tree eliminates AI confusion about when to track

**Implementation Notes:**
This addresses your observation that registry tracking never worked. Move to DDD principle: bounded contexts own their own tracking.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F009**
**Name**: Template Instruction Separation
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Eliminates confusion between "maintaining the template" and "creating a document from template". Current v4.0 mixes template maintenance instructions with document creation instructions. New approach: complete separation. Templates contain ONLY document creation instructions with clear removal markers. All maintenance/versioning protocols move to TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Will removal markers be consistently removed? (Yes - Sonnet 4.5 can identify XML-style comments easily)
- ✅ Should maintenance doc be per-template or system-wide? (System-wide - versioning rules apply to all)
- ✅ What about template version history? (Separate changelog file - template-version-history.md)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Create TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md with all versioning/update protocols
- Remove all maintenance instructions from individual template files
- Add XML-style comment markers for template instructions
- Define removal marker format: `<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION - REMOVE IN GENERATED DOCUMENT ... END TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION -->`
- Update all templates with clear removal markers
- Update kickstarter with template usage guidance
- Keep template-version-history.md for changelog only

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: F001 (templates have clear single purpose)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **Template Files**: ONLY document creation instructions + removal markers
- **TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md**: Versioning rules, update protocols, maintenance guidance
- **template-version-history.md**: Changelog only (what changed when)
- **Removal Marker Format**: XML-style comments Sonnet 4.5 can easily identify
- **Creation vs Maintenance**: Clear separation prevents confusion

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - File reorganization
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Clarifies existing process
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained within template system

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] 0% template instructions in generated documents
- [x] Clear separation between "using template" and "maintaining template"
- [x] Consistent removal of instruction markers

**Implementation Notes:**
Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following makes this reliable. Clear markers prevent accidental inclusion in generated docs.

#### **Feature: TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-F010**
**Name**: Version Alignment to v5.0.0
**Status**: [x] Ready for Implementation
**Confidence Level**: [x] High
**Domain Assignment**: [x] Single Domain (Context Engineering System)

**Business Value Hypothesis:**
Eliminates confusion about what works with what. Current state: templates at v4.0.0, system at v1.1 - unclear compatibility. New approach: System and all templates versioned to v5.0.0 together. Clear rule: v5.0 system works with v5.x templates. Individual template patches use v5.0.1, v5.0.2, etc. Next major system version bumps all templates to v6.0.0.

**Exploration Questions:**
- ✅ Should we ever go backwards in version numbers? (NO - your explicit requirement)
- ✅ What about templates already at v4.0.0? (Jump to v5.0.0 - never backwards)
- ✅ How to track version changes? (template-version-history.md changelog)

**Potential Technical Scope:**
- Update context-engineering-system.md to v5.0.0
- Update context-engineering-kickstarter.md to v5.0.0
- Update ALL templates to v5.0.0 (from current v4.0.0 and v1.x)
- Update template-version-history.md with v5.0.0 entry
- Define version alignment rule in TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md
- Add compatibility matrix to kickstarter
- Version all future system changes together

**Potential Dependencies:**
- **Internal**: All previous features (F001-F009 define what v5.0 includes)
- **External**: None

**Domain Model Speculation:**
- **System Version**: v5.0.0 (from v1.1)
- **Template Versions**: All v5.0.0 (from v4.0.0 and v1.x)
- **Version Alignment Rule**: Major system version (v5) = Major template version (v5.x.x)
- **Patch Versions**: Individual templates can be v5.0.1, v5.0.2 for minor fixes
- **Next Major**: v6.0 system → all templates become v6.0.0
- **Changelog Entry**: Document v5.0.0 as "Sonnet 4.5 Optimization" with all 10 features

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Technical Risk**: [x] Low - Version number updates
- **Business Risk**: [x] Low - Clarifies compatibility
- **Integration Risk**: [x] Low - Self-contained versioning metadata

**Success Criteria (Preliminary):**
- [x] All system docs and templates show v5.0.0 version
- [x] Clear changelog entry documenting v5.0.0 changes
- [x] Version alignment rule documented for future updates

**Implementation Notes:**
This addresses your specific requirement: "if we already have one file at v4.x then we should move to v5.x everywhere... going backwards in versions is never a good idea."

## **CONCEPT VALIDATION APPROACH**

### **Business Validation**
**Stakeholder Validation:**
- Creator (you) - Primary stakeholder and system designer
- Future AI development teams - Will use v5.0 workflow
- Current Context Engineering users - Need smooth transition

**Market Validation:**
- Dog-fooding: Use v5.0 to implement itself (validates practicality)
- Real-world test: This very concept development demonstrates 7-step process
- Pain point validation: Each feature addresses documented v4.0 issue

### **Technical Validation**
**Proof of Concept Approach:**
- Generate this concept.req.md using v4.0 process (testing current system)
- Run codification ICP to update system docs (testing transition)
- Execute implementation ICP for template updates (testing final workflow)
- Compare execution quality v4.0 vs v5.0 (measuring improvement)

**Architecture Validation:**
- Three-tier hierarchy prevents instruction conflicts
- Decentralized tracking aligns with DDD principles
- State persistence survives context rollovers
- Self-validation catches skipped steps

## **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (Preliminary)**

### **Concept-to-Domain Evolution**
**Multi-Domain Scenario:**
This concept spans the entire Context Engineering System infrastructure:
- Update `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/context-engineering-system.md` (v5.0.0)
- Update `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Kickstarters/context-engineering-kickstarter.md` (v5.0.0)
- Update `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/*.md` (all to v5.0.0)
- Create `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md` (new file)
- Update `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/Templates/template-version-history.md` (v5.0.0 entry)
- Archive `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/capability-registry.md` (eliminated)
- Archive this concept to `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/NewConcepts/Implemented/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-context-engineering-v5.concept.req.md`

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
**High-Risk Elements:**
- **Breaking changes to existing ICPs in progress**: Mitigation - Complete any active ICPs before v5.0 rollout, or provide v4.0 → v5.0 migration guide
- **User confusion during transition**: Mitigation - Clear v5.0.0 version markers, changelog explaining changes, side-by-side comparison doc
- **Template instruction removal failures**: Mitigation - Test with multiple template types, verify Sonnet 4.5 reliably removes markers

**Validation Gates:**
- **Gate 1**: Concept.req.md approved (this document)
- **Gate 2**: Codification ICP specifications approved (domain.req updates, implementation.icp generation)
- **Gate 3**: Implementation ICP execution approved (each phase requires human approval)
- **Gate 4**: Final v5.0.0 system tested with dog-fooding example

## **SUCCESS MEASUREMENT**

### **Concept Success Criteria**
**Business Success:**
- 90%+ reduction in workflow violations (skipped tests, ignored gates, lost context)
- 40%+ faster execution through clearer instructions
- 100% successful context rollover recovery
