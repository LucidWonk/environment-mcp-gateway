# ICP-CONCEPT: Context Engineering System v5.0 - Documentation Codification

## **CONCEPT OVERVIEW**

The Context Engineering System v5.0 represents a comprehensive redesign to leverage Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following capabilities. This codification ICP will update all Context Engineering documentation and templates to v5.0.0, implementing 10 features optimized for Sonnet 4.5 while eliminating known pain points from v4.0.

**🛑 CODIFICATION PURPOSE**: This document provides SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS for future implementation - NO code changes should occur during this phase.

**ICP Type**: [x] Codification (Specifications Only) | ❌ NO IMPLEMENTATION ALLOWED ❌
**CRITICAL**: This is a CODIFICATION ICP - DOCUMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION ONLY
**PROHIBITED**: Code implementation, file modifications, system deployment, test execution
**Concept Scope**: [x] Architectural Enhancement
**Documentation Impact**: [x] Multiple Related Documents
**Build Dependencies**: [x] No Prerequisites
**Complexity**: [x] Complex
**Expert Coordination**: [ ] Enabled (v4.0.0) | [x] Disabled

## **CAPABILITY REGISTRY MAINTENANCE**

**Registry Update Requirements:**

### **For NewConcepts Concept ICPs (Exploratory Documentation):**
**IMPORTANT**: NewConcepts use different registry approach to avoid cleanup complexity.

**When Working with NewConcept Requirements:**
1. **DO NOT** register placeholder capability IDs (TEMP-CTXENG-V5UPGRADE-x7k2)
2. **REFERENCE** placeholder IDs consistently in all concept documentation
3. **NOTE**: Final capability registration happens during implementation ICP execution
4. **VALIDATE**: Ensure placeholder ID format is correct and consistent

**Registry Interaction Pattern:**
- **NewConcepts**: PLACEHOLDER IDs only, avoid registry until implementation
- **MAINTAIN** registry as single source of truth for implemented capabilities

## **CURRENT CAPABILITY STATE**

**Business Capability Gap:**

The Context Engineering System v4.0 was designed for earlier Sonnet versions (4.0/4.1) which struggled with complex nested instructions, competing guidance sources, and maintaining state across context window rollovers. Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following capabilities enable significant simplification and reliability improvements, but current v4.0 documentation doesn't leverage these capabilities.

**Current Documentation Status:**

**Version Misalignment Issues:**
- context-engineering-system.md is at v1.1
- Templates are at v4.0.0
- Unclear which versions work together
- No clear compatibility matrix

**Instruction Hierarchy Problems:**
- System overview contains execution details (should be conceptual only)
- Kickstarter lacks decision trees and workflow patterns
- Templates reference other docs instead of being self-contained
- Competing instructions across 9 documents causing AI confusion

**Stop Gate Failures:**
- Current stop gates frequently ignored (~20% violation rate)
- "Helpful context" after gates tempts AI to continue
- No visual barriers to prevent continuation
- Weak enforcement of human approval requirements

**Context Rollover Fragility:**
- No resilience mechanism when context window refreshes
- AI loses track of execution position
- No state tracking or re-grounding protocol
- Long implementations fail unpredictably

**Capability Tracking Problems:**
- capability-registry.md "never works properly" (creator observation)
- Central registry gets out of sync with req files
- Unclear when to add/update tracking
- Registry maintenance overhead

**Phase Boundary Violations:**
- AI writes code during codification phase
- AI modifies specs during implementation phase
- Vague guidance about phase scope
- No clear tool restriction lists

**Specification Pain Points:**
- Complex A-I subtask structure hard to track (9 sequential items)
- Subtasks D, E, F frequently skipped (testing, validation, documentation)
- No self-validation framework
- Template maintenance instructions mixed with document creation instructions
- Template instruction markers sometimes left in generated documents

**Business Impact:**
- **Capability Development**: 90% of workflow violations occur (skipped tests, ignored gates, lost context)
- **Integration Clarity**: 40% slower execution due to instruction ambiguity
- **Implementation Efficiency**: Context rollovers cause unpredictable failures in long implementations

## **DESIRED SPECIFICATION STATE**

**Capability Specification Objective:**

**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: All ICP templates - Validation checkpoint sections
**Document Format**: MUST follow template structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Addresses critical issue where AI skips testing (subtask D), validation (E), and documentation (F). Sonnet 4.5 explicitly validates its own work at checkpoints with mandatory PASS/FAIL assessment. If FAIL, must identify gaps and complete before proceeding. Creates audit trail of self-monitoring.

**Source Requirements:**
- Current v4.0 relies on implicit instructions for validation
- Subtasks D, E, F frequently skipped (testing, validation, documentation)
- No self-validation framework

**Technical Scope:**
- Create self-validation checkpoint template

- **Event Integration**: N/A
- **UI Integration**: Validation results visible in execution history

**Quality Requirements:**
- **Performance**: 0% skipped validation steps (D, E, F currently problematic)
- **Security**: N/A
- **Reliability**: 100% of implementations have passing tests before proceeding
- **Compliance**: Clear audit trail showing AI validated its own work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 0% skipped validation steps
- [ ] 100% of implementations have passing tests before proceeding
- [ ] Clear audit trail showing AI validated its own work
- [ ] Explicit PASS/FAIL assessment with reasoning

**Implementation Notes:**

This is the "Context Engineering Compliance Agent" mentioned but never implemented. It's not a separate tool - it's self-validation checkpoints throughout execution.

---

**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: All ICP templates - Phase scope sections
**Document Format**: MUST follow template structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Prevents common error where AI writes code during codification phase or modifies specs during implementation phase. Explicit ALLOWED and PROHIBITED tool lists for each phase. Codification can only touch *.req.md and *.icp.md files. Implementation can touch code but not req files (specs frozen).

**Source Requirements:**
- Current v4.0 has vague guidance about phase scope
- AI writes code during codification phase
- AI modifies specs during implementation phase
- No clear tool restriction lists

**Technical Scope:**
- Create tool restriction templates for codification phase

- Add prerequisite checks (implementation requires approved codification)
- Update templates with restriction blocks
- Add exception protocol for edge cases

**Technical Dependencies:**
- **Internal Dependencies**: F001 (templates have enforcement authority)
- **External Dependencies**: Claude Code tool availability

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Data Integration**: Tool restrictions integrated into phase definitions
- **API Integration**: N/A (manual compliance based on clear lists)
- **Event Integration**: N/A
- **UI Integration**: Clear visual lists make violations obvious to both AI and human reviewers

**Quality Requirements:**
- **Performance**: 0% code changes during codification phase
- **Security**: N/A
- **Reliability**: 0% spec changes during implementation phase
- **Compliance**: Clear escalation path for edge cases requiring exceptions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 0% code changes during codification phase
- [ ] 0% spec changes during implementation phase
- [ ] Clear escalation path for edge cases requiring exceptions
- [ ] Visual ALLOWED/PROHIBITED lists in each phase

**Implementation Notes:**

Cannot technically enforce (no API to disable tools), but clear visual lists make violations obvious to both AI and human reviewers.

**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: All ICP templates - Rollover protocol sections
**Document Format**: MUST follow template structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Provides systematic recovery mechanism when context window rolls over mid-execution. Two-level protocol: Level 1 (always): read state block for instant re-orientation. Level 2 (when uncertain): full re-grounding by re-reading kickstarter and template. Explicit confidence check with STOP if LOW confidence.

**Source Requirements:**
- Current v4.0 has no protocol for context rollover
- Long implementations fail unpredictably when context refreshes
- AI loses track of execution position after rollover

**Technical Scope:**
- Add rollover detection section to all ICP templates
- Define two-level protocol (lightweight vs full re-grounding)
- Create re-grounding checklist (what to read, in what order)
- Add confidence assessment checkpoint (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Add STOP protocol for LOW confidence
- Integrate with F003 state blocks (Level 1 reads state)
- Update kickstarter with rollover guidance

**Technical Dependencies:**

- **Compliance**: Minimal overhead (Level 1 sufficient in most cases)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 100% successful resumption after context rollover
- [ ] Clear confidence assessment visible to user
- [ ] Minimal overhead (Level 1 sufficient in most cases)
- [ ] Explicit STOP if LOW confidence

**Implementation Notes:**

Option C (Hybrid) selected: always read state block (lightweight), full re-grounding only when uncertain. Level 1: Read state block. Level 2: Read kickstarter → Read template → Review state → Assess confidence.

#### **Feature 8: Decentralized Capability Tracking**
**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: template.domain.req.md, template.digital.req.md - Capability tracking sections
**Document Format**: MUST follow template structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Eliminates problematic capability-registry.md which "never works properly" (creator observation). Each domain.req.md and digital.req.md tracks its own capabilities and features with status. Aligns with DDD bounded context principle (each domain owns its tracking). Includes simple decision tree for AI to execute at point of need.

**Source Requirements:**
- capability-registry.md "never works properly"
- Central registry gets out of sync with req files
- Unclear when to add/update tracking
- Registry maintenance overhead

**Technical Scope:**
- Remove capability-registry.md from Context Engineering system
- Update template.domain.req.md with capability tracking section
- Update template.digital.req.md with capability tracking section
- Define capability tracking format (ID, status, implementation date, coverage, features)
- Define feature tracking format (ID, status, tests, location)
- Create decision tree for when to add/update tracking
- Update kickstarter with decentralized tracking guidance
- Archive capability-registry.md with explanation of why it was eliminated

**Technical Dependencies:**
- **Internal Dependencies**: F001 (templates define new tracking structure)
- **External Dependencies**: None

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Data Integration**: Tracking colocated with specifications
- **API Integration**: N/A
- **Event Integration**: N/A
- **UI Integration**: N/A

**Quality Requirements:**
- **Performance**: No capability-registry.md to maintain
- **Security**: N/A
- **Reliability**: Tracking colocated with specifications (single source of truth)
- **Compliance**: Clear decision tree eliminates AI confusion about when to track

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] No capability-registry.md to maintain or get out of sync
- [ ] Tracking colocated with specifications (single source of truth)
- [ ] Clear decision tree eliminates AI confusion about when to track
- [ ] System-wide view can be generated on-demand from req files

**Implementation Notes:**

Move to DDD principle: bounded contexts own their own tracking. Decision tree: NewConcepts (placeholder, no tracking) → Creating capability (add to req file) → Implementing (update status) → No action.

---

#### **Feature 9: Template Instruction Separation**
**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: All templates, new TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md file
**Document Format**: MUST follow template structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Eliminates confusion between "maintaining the template" and "creating a document from template". Complete separation: Templates contain ONLY document creation instructions with clear removal markers. All maintenance/versioning protocols move to TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md.

**Source Requirements:**
- Current v4.0 mixes template maintenance instructions with document creation instructions
- Template instruction markers sometimes left in generated documents
- Unclear separation between "using template" and "maintaining template"

**Technical Scope:**
- Create TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md with all versioning/update protocols
- Remove all maintenance instructions from individual template files
- Add XML-style comment markers for template instructions
- Define removal marker format: `<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION - REMOVE IN GENERATED DOCUMENT ... END TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION -->`
- Update all templates with clear removal markers
- Update kickstarter with template usage guidance
- Keep template-version-history.md for changelog only

**Technical Dependencies:**
- **Internal Dependencies**: F001 (templates have clear single purpose)
- **External Dependencies**: None

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Data Integration**: Clear separation between template files and maintenance doc
- **API Integration**: N/A
- **Event Integration**: N/A
- **UI Integration**: N/A

**Quality Requirements:**
- **Performance**: 0% template instructions in generated documents
- **Security**: N/A
- **Reliability**: Clear separation between "using template" and "maintaining template"
- **Compliance**: Consistent removal of instruction markers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 0% template instructions in generated documents
- [ ] Clear separation between "using template" and "maintaining template"
- [ ] Consistent removal of instruction markers
- [ ] All maintenance protocols in TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md

**Implementation Notes:**

Sonnet 4.5's enhanced instruction-following makes this reliable. Clear XML-style markers prevent accidental inclusion in generated docs.

---

#### **Feature 10: Version Alignment to v5.0.0**
**Implementation Status**: [x] Not Implemented
**Target Document**: All Context Engineering docs and templates
**Document Format**: MUST follow version metadata structure
**Future Implementation ICP**: "Pending"

**Business Description:**

Individual template patches use v5.0.1, v5.0.2, etc. Next major system version bumps all templates to v6.0.0. Never go backwards in version numbers.

**Source Requirements:**
- Current state: templates at v4.0.0, system at v1.1 - unclear compatibility
- No version alignment rule
- Unclear what works with what

**Technical Scope:**
- Update context-engineering-system.md to v5.0.0
- Update context-engineering-kickstarter.md to v5.0.0
- Update ALL templates to v5.0.0 (from current v4.0.0 and v1.x)
- Update template-version-history.md with v5.0.0 entry
- Define version alignment rule in TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md

- **External Dependencies**: None

**Integration Requirements:**
- **Data Integration**: All docs/templates aligned to v5.0.0
- **API Integration**: N/A
- **Event Integration**: N/A
- **UI Integration**: Version alignment visible in all doc headers

**Quality Requirements:**
- **Performance**: All system docs and templates show v5.0.0 version
- **Security**: N/A
- **Reliability**: Clear changelog entry documenting v5.0.0 changes
- **Compliance**: Version alignment rule documented for future updates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All system docs and templates show v5.0.0 version
- [ ] Clear changelog entry documenting v5.0.0 changes
- [ ] Version alignment rule documented for future updates
- [ ] Never go backwards in version numbers

**Implementation Notes:**

Version alignment rule: Major system version (v5) = Major template version (v5.x.x). Patch versions for individual templates: v5.0.1, v5.0.2. Next major: v6.0 system → all templates become v6.0.0.
