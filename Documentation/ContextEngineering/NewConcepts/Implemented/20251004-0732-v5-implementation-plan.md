# Context Engineering v5.0 - Actual Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Planning - Ready for Approval
**Problem**: We updated version numbers to v5.0.0 but didn't implement the actual structural changes

## **PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS**

### What We Did (Incorrectly)
✅ Updated TEMPLATE_VERSION metadata to v5.0.0
✅ Added VERSION 5.0.0 MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS comments listing features
✅ Added "v5.0 TEMPLATE FEATURES" notes describing what should be there
✅ Created TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md documentation
✅ Updated template-version-history.md

### What We Didn't Do (The Actual Work)
❌ Restructure templates with actual bunker-style stop gates
❌ Add actual state persistence blocks to ICP templates
❌ Replace A-I subtask structure with actual 3x3 execution blocks
❌ Add actual PASS/FAIL validation checkpoints
❌ Add actual ALLOWED/PROHIBITED tool restriction lists
❌ Add actual context rollover protocol instructions
❌ Restructure system docs with three-tier architecture content
❌ Add actual decision trees and workflow patterns to kickstarter

### Cleanup Needed
❌ Move `context-engineering-v5.implementation.icp.md` to Implemented/ folder

## **THE 10 FEATURES - WHAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO CHANGE**

### Feature 1: Three-Tier Instruction Architecture ⚠️ PARTIALLY DONE
**Status**: Documentation written, structure needs verification
**Files**: context-engineering-system.md, context-engineering-kickstarter.md, all templates
**What Should Change**:
- System overview: Remove execution details, keep only conceptual "why" content
- Kickstarter: Add decision trees, workflow patterns (might be done?)
- Templates: Self-contained execution instructions (need to verify)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AI can execute from templates without referencing other docs
- [ ] No instruction conflicts between tiers
- [ ] Clear hierarchy: Templates (authority) > Kickstarter (workflow) > System (concepts)

### Feature 2: Bunker-Style Stop Gates ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: CRITICAL - Only described in comments, not actually implemented
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates
**What Should Change**:
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE (Current - Weak) -->
## **HUMAN APPROVAL GATE**
Please review and approve before continuing.

```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Visual box-drawing barriers at every stop gate
- [ ] Current state explicitly declared
- [ ] Prohibited actions explicitly listed
- [ ] ZERO content after gate (0% violation target)

### Feature 3: State Persistence Blocks ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: CRITICAL - Only described, not implemented
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates (codification, implementation, setup)
**What Should Change**:
Add this at the TOP of every ICP template, right after metadata:
```markdown

**🔄 CONTEXT ROLLOVER PROTOCOL**: If you're resuming after context refresh:
1. READ this state block first
2. Verify understanding of current position
3. If uncertain, read Kickstarter for workflow guidance
4. If still uncertain, read System Overview for context
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] State block at top of every ICP
- [ ] AI updates state block after every action
- [ ] 100% context rollover recovery rate

### Feature 4: 3x3 Execution Block Structure ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: CRITICAL - Still using A-I subtask structure
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates
**What Should Change**:
```markdown
<!-- BEFORE (Current - A-I Subtasks) -->
**AI EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:**
Execute these tasks in strict sequence A → I:
- **Subtask A**: Validate prerequisites
- **Subtask B**: Expert coordination
- **Subtask C**: Implementation planning
- **Subtask D**: Core implementation
- **Subtask E**: Test coverage
- **Subtask F**: Validation
- **Subtask G**: Documentation
- **Subtask H**: Final validation
- **Subtask I**: Completion tracking

<!-- AFTER (v5.0 - 3x3 Blocks) -->
**STEP EXECUTION STRUCTURE:**

**🔷 PREPARATION BLOCK (Complete all before proceeding)**
1. Validate prerequisites and dependencies
2. Read relevant requirement documents
3. Confirm understanding and approach

**🔷 EXECUTION BLOCK (Complete all before proceeding)**
1. Implement code changes
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Validate build and all tests pass

**🔷 FINALIZATION BLOCK (Complete all before stop gate)**
1. Update documentation
2. Self-validate against acceptance criteria (PASS/FAIL)
3. Update state persistence block
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All ICP templates use 3x3 structure (not A-I)
- [ ] Each block clearly delineated
- [ ] Blocks must complete fully before next block

### Feature 5: Self-Validation Framework ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: CRITICAL - No actual validation checkpoints
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates
**What Should Change**:
Add to every step's Finalization Block:
```markdown
**SELF-VALIDATION CHECKPOINT**

Execute this validation BEFORE proceeding to stop gate:

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Code implemented per spec | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | [file:line references] |
| Tests written and passing | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | [test file references] |
| Build succeeds | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | [build output] |
| Documentation updated | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | [doc file references] |
| Acceptance criteria met | [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL | [criteria checklist] |

**VALIDATION RESULT**: [ ] ALL PASS - Proceed to stop gate
                        [ ] ANY FAIL - Fix before stop gate

**PROHIBITED**: Proceeding to stop gate with ANY failure status
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Every step has validation checkpoint
- [ ] PASS/FAIL mandatory before stop gate
- [ ] Cannot proceed with ANY failure

### Feature 6: Phase-Specific Tool Restrictions ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: CRITICAL - No tool restriction lists
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates
**What Should Change**:
Add to every phase header:
```markdown
## **PHASE 1: [Phase Name]**

**ALLOWED TOOLS FOR THIS PHASE**:
✅ Read - Understanding existing code and docs
✅ Grep - Searching for patterns
✅ Glob - Finding files
✅ Bash (read-only) - Checking system state

**PROHIBITED TOOLS FOR THIS PHASE**:
❌ Write - No file creation
❌ Edit - No file modifications
❌ Bash (write) - No system changes
❌ Git - No commits during execution

**PHASE BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT**:
If you attempt prohibited tools, STOP and explain why the phase boundary was violated.
```
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Every phase has ALLOWED/PROHIBITED lists
- [ ] Lists are specific to phase purpose
- [ ] Clear enforcement instructions

### Feature 7: Context Rollover Protocol ❌ NOT DONE
**Status**: Already specified in Feature 3's state block, needs verification
**Files**: All 3 ICP templates, kickstarter
**What Should Change**: (Already part of state persistence block)
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Level 1 protocol in state block
- [ ] Level 2 protocol documented in kickstarter
- [ ] Clear instructions for uncertain state

### Feature 8: Decentralized Capability Tracking ✅ DONE
**Status**: COMPLETE - capability-registry.md marked deprecated
**Files**: N/A
**What Was Done**: Eliminated central registry, tracking in req files
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] capability-registry.md marked DEPRECATED
- [x] Tracking instructions in domain/digital templates

### Feature 9: Template Instruction Separation ✅ DONE
**Status**: COMPLETE - TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md created
**Files**: TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md
**What Was Done**: Maintenance guidance separated from templates
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md exists with comprehensive guidance
- [x] Templates have usage instructions only

### Feature 10: Version Alignment to v5.0.0 ✅ DONE (Metadata Only)
**Status**: Metadata updated, structural changes pending
**Files**: All 11 files
**What Was Done**: Version numbers updated to v5.0.0
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] All files show v5.0.0 in metadata
- [ ] All files actually implement v5.0 features (PENDING)

## **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Single Template)**
**Goal**: Validate v5.0 design with one complete example
**File**: template.implementation.icp.md

**Step 1.1: Create v5.0 Proof-of-Concept**
- Take template.implementation.icp.md
- Actually implement ALL structural changes:
  - Add state persistence block at top
  - Replace A-I subtasks with 3x3 blocks
  - Add bunker-style stop gates
  - Add PASS/FAIL validation checkpoints
  - Add ALLOWED/PROHIBITED tool lists per phase
  - Restructure as self-contained (no external references)
- Save as: `template.implementation.icp.v5-proof.md` (temporary)

**Step 1.2: Human Review & Approval**
- Show before/after comparison
- Validate v5.0 features are actually present
- Get approval on design before applying to other templates

**🛑 STOP GATE**: Human approval required before Phase 2

### **Phase 2: Apply to All ICP Templates**
**Goal**: Update remaining ICP templates with approved v5.0 structure
**Files**: template.codification.icp.md, template.setup.icp.md

**Step 2.1: Update template.codification.icp.md**
- Apply same structural changes as proof-of-concept
- Adapt 3x3 blocks for codification workflow
- Adapt tool restrictions for codification phase (no code changes allowed)

**Step 2.2: Update template.setup.icp.md**
- Apply same structural changes
- Adapt 3x3 blocks for setup workflow
- Adapt tool restrictions for setup phase

**Step 2.3: Finalize template.implementation.icp.md**
- Replace current version with approved proof-of-concept
- Remove temporary proof file

**🛑 STOP GATE**: Human approval before Phase 3

### **Phase 3: Requirements Templates (Minimal Changes)**
**Goal**: Determine and apply necessary changes to requirements templates
**Files**: template.concept.req.md, template.domain.req.md, template.digital.req.md, template.prp.req.md

**Analysis**: Requirements templates are NOT execution-focused, so most v5.0 features don't apply:
- ❌ No state persistence blocks (not execution documents)
- ❌ No 3x3 blocks (not execution documents)
- ❌ No bunker stop gates (no AI execution steps)
- ❌ No validation checkpoints (no execution)
- ❌ No tool restrictions (no execution)
- ✅ Keep version alignment to v5.0.0
- ✅ Keep decentralized capability tracking notes
- ✅ Keep three-tier architecture notes

**Step 3.1: Review Requirements Templates**
- Read current state of all 4 templates
- Confirm minimal changes needed (just metadata + tracking notes)
- Verify they already have what they need

**🛑 STOP GATE**: Human approval before Phase 4

### **Phase 4: System Documentation**
**Goal**: Verify system docs have actual v5.0 content (not just version bumps)
**Files**: context-engineering-system.md, context-engineering-kickstarter.md

**Step 4.1: Verify context-engineering-system.md**
- Read current state
- Verify it has actual three-tier architecture explanation
- Verify execution details removed (conceptual only)
- Fix if needed

**Step 4.2: Verify context-engineering-kickstarter.md**
- Read current state
- Verify it has actual decision trees
- Verify it has actual workflow patterns
- Verify it has context rollover protocol (Level 2)
- Fix if needed

**🛑 STOP GATE**: Human approval before Phase 5

### **Phase 5: Validation**
**Goal**: Verify all v5.0 features actually present

**Step 5.1: Feature Presence Checklist**
Create validation matrix:

| Feature | template.impl | template.codif | template.setup | system.md | kickstarter.md |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| F1: Three-tier architecture | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| F2: Bunker stop gates | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| F3: State persistence | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| F4: 3x3 blocks | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| F5: Self-validation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| F6: Tool restrictions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| F7: Rollover protocol | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ✅ |
| F8: Decentralized tracking | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✅ | ✅ |
| F9: Instruction separation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| F10: Version alignment | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Step 5.2: Read-Through Validation**
- Read each updated file
- Verify v5.0 features are structurally present (not just described)
- Document any gaps

**🛑 STOP GATE**: Human approval before Phase 6

### **Phase 6: Cleanup and Finalization**
**Goal**: Archive implementation ICP, update tracking

**Step 6.1: Move Implementation ICP**
- Move `context-engineering-v5.implementation.icp.md` to `Implemented/20251004-0732-context-engineering-v5.implementation.icp.md`

**Step 6.2: Update Checkpoint**
- Update CHECKPOINT-v5-upgrade.md with "Actual v5.0 implementation complete"
- Note that we corrected the initial metadata-only update

**Step 6.3: Final Validation**
- All templates actually implement v5.0 features structurally
- All version numbers at v5.0.0
- All files properly archived
- System ready for use

**🛑 FINAL STOP GATE**: Complete - Ready for git commit

## **FILES REQUIRING ACTUAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES**

### Critical (Must Change Structure)
1. ✅ `template.implementation.icp.md` - Add state blocks, 3x3, bunker gates, validation, tool lists
2. ✅ `template.codification.icp.md` - Same structural changes
3. ✅ `template.setup.icp.md` - Same structural changes

### Verify/Fix
4. ⚠️ `context-engineering-system.md` - Verify three-tier content present
