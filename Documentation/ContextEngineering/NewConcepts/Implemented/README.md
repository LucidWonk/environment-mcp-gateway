# Implemented NewConcepts Archive

## Purpose
This folder contains original NewConcept documents that have been successfully implemented and restructured into mature domain documents.

## File Naming Convention
Completed ICPs and requirements use timestamp prefixes to show execution order:
- Format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-original-name.extension.md`
- Example: `20250803-1430-context-engineering-enhancement.implement.icp.md`

## Document Contents
Each archived document includes:
- **Forward References**: Links to the mature documents that replaced it
- **Implementation Summary**: What was actually built vs originally conceived
- **Domain Discovery Notes**: How the concept evolved during implementation
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights for future NewConcept development

## Usage Notes
- **Historical Reference**: Review past concepts to understand evolution patterns
- **Learning Resource**: See how concepts naturally split across domains
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common NewConcept â†’ Domain migration patterns
- **Process Improvement**: Learn from successful and challenging implementations

## Integration with System
- These documents are referenced by the capability registry
- They provide audit trail for concept evolution
- They help validate the NewConcepts process effectiveness
- They inform future concept boundary decisions
