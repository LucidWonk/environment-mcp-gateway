## USAGE PATTERNS

### **Standard Invocation Pattern**

```typescript
// 1. Select expert via F001 (expert-select-workflow)
const selection = await expertSelectWorkflow({
    workflowDescription: "Implement Fibonacci retracement calculator",
    riskLevel: "Medium"
});

// 2. Package context via F004 (context-transfer-utility)
const contextPackage = await contextTransferUtility({
    sourceContext: fullContext,
    agentPromptTemplate: selection.agentPrompts[0].promptTemplate,
    contextScope: "focused"
});

// 3. Inject standards and context into prompt
const completePrompt = selection.agentPrompts[0].promptTemplate
    .replace('{PLATFORM_STANDARDS_INJECTION}', platformStandards)
    .replace('{SUBTASK_DESCRIPTION}', "Validate Fibonacci calculation algorithm")
    .replace('{AGENT_CONTEXT_PACKAGE}', contextPackage.packagedContext);

// 4. Dispatch to Task agent
const agentResult = await Task({
    prompt: completePrompt,
    timeout: selection.agentPrompts[0].timeoutMs
});

// 5. Analyze results via F005 (expert-conflict-resolve)
const conflictAnalysis = await expertConflictResolve({
    expertRecommendations: [agentResult],
    conflictSeverity: "medium"
});

// 6. Validate implementation via F006 (expert-validate-implementation)
const validation = await expertValidateImplementation({
    implementationPath: "path/to/code",
    expertRecommendations: [agentResult],
    validationScope: "comprehensive"

```

### **Multi-Agent Parallel Pattern**

```typescript
// Select multiple experts
const selection = await expertSelectWorkflow({
    workflowDescription: "Complex cross-domain feature",
    riskLevel: "High"
});

// Dispatch all experts in parallel (single message, multiple Task calls)
const agentResults = await Promise.all(
    selection.agentPrompts.map(async (prompt) => {
        const context = await contextTransferUtility({...});
        const completePrompt = injectStandards(prompt.promptTemplate);
        return Task({ prompt: completePrompt });
    })
);

// Synthesize results and detect conflicts
const synthesis = await expertConflictResolve({
    expertRecommendations: agentResults,
    conflictSeverity: "medium"
});
```

## VERSION CONTROL & REFINEMENT

### **Prompt Effectiveness Tracking** (F007 Integration)

Each expert persona should be continuously refined based on:
- **Task Completion Rate**: % of tasks successfully completed
- **Recommendation Adoption Rate**: % of recommendations implemented
- **Deliverable Quality Score**: Human-rated quality of outputs
- **Time Performance**: Actual vs target completion time
- **Conflict Rate**: Frequency of conflicts with other experts

### **Refinement Process**

1. **Collect Metrics**: F007 agent-coordination-metrics tracks effectiveness
2. **Identify Patterns**: Low-performing personas or deliverable types
3. **Refine Prompts**: Update prompt templates with:
   - Clearer deliverable specifications
   - Enhanced quality standards
   - Better context injection points
   - Improved output format guidance
4. **Version Control**: Commit changes with effectiveness data justification
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare old vs new prompt performance

### **Change History**

| Version | Date | Changes | Rationale |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| 5.1.0 | 2025-10-05 | Initial v5.1 persona library | F002 - Extracted from v4.0 hard-coded prompts |
