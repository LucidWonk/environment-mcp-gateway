═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEMPLATE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI (DO NOT INCLUDE IN FINAL DOCUMENTS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When updating this template, the AI MUST follow these instructions:

1. VERSION INCREMENTATION:
   - Major (x.0.0): Fundamental changes to template structure or execution model
   - Minor (x.y.0): Significant enhancements like new sections or validation requirements
   - Patch (x.y.z): Minor tweaks, typo fixes, or small clarifications
   - ALWAYS increment version when making ANY change
   - UPDATE TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION to reflect changes

   VERSION 5.0.0 MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Decentralized capability tracking (capabilities tracked in-document, not central registry)
   - Template instruction separation (maintenance guidance → TEMPLATE-MAINTENANCE.md)
   - Version alignment with Context Engineering System v5.0.0
   - Capability/feature tracking section added to template

2. TIME REFERENCE REMOVAL:
   - NEVER include time estimates (minutes, hours, days) in any section
   - Use complexity indicators instead: "Simple task", "Complex implementation", "Multiple components"
   - Use dependency counts: "3 files to modify", "5 test cases required", "2 integrations needed"
   - Use completion metrics: "Until all tests pass", "Until build succeeds", "Until validation complete"

3. PRIORITY AND ORDERING:
   - Base ALL priorities on technical build dependencies, NOT business value
   - Sequence features by: "Must complete X before Y can begin"
   - Use dependency-driven language: "Requires foundation components", "Depends on Feature X completion"
   - Avoid value judgments: "Important", "Critical", "High-priority" unless referring to technical blocking

4. TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION HANDLING:
   - These "TEMPLATE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS" sections are for AI template maintenance only
   - NEVER copy these sections to documents created from templates
   - Only copy content between the template instruction blocks to final documents
   - Remove ALL template instruction comments from generated documents

5. INSTRUCTION PROPAGATION RULES:
   - Template instructions (marked with "DO NOT INCLUDE IN FINAL") stay in templates only
   - Content instructions (for document creation) get copied to generated documents
   - Metadata fields (TEMPLATE_FILE, TEMPLATE_VERSION) get copied for traceability

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WILL RESULT IN CORRUPTED TEMPLATE SYSTEM.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEMPLATE USAGE INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT INCLUDE IN FINAL DOCUMENT)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
This template defines ONE digital/user-facing capability (deployable artifact).

CAPABILITY ID GENERATION AND REGISTRY:
1. Generate unique ID: [DOMAIN]-[NAME]-[4-random-chars]
   Example: UI-DASHBOARD-f2d1
2. Check /Documentation/ContextEngineering/capability-registry.md for conflicts
3. ADD new capability to registry with:
   - Status: "Not Started"
   - Created Date: Today's date
   - Implementation ICP: "TBD"
   - Document: This file's name

CRITICAL: Digital documents describe USER-FACING capabilities (UI, UX, interactions)
Different from Domain documents which describe BUSINESS capabilities.

FEATURE TRACKING:
- Each feature gets ID: [CAPABILITY-ID]-F[###]
- Track implementation status and ICP references
- Update feature status when ICPs implement them

DEPENDENCIES:
- List other domain/digital capabilities this depends on
- Use capability IDs from the registry
- Specify dependency type (API, Event, UI Component, etc.)

IMPORTANT: This is a specification document. Implementation happens through ICPs.

TEMPLATE VERSIONING:
When creating documents from this template, ensure:
1. Use the TEMPLATE_FILE and TEMPLATE_VERSION defined above for metadata fields:
   - "Generated From Template" field: [TEMPLATE_FILE] v[TEMPLATE_VERSION]
   - "Template Version" field: [TEMPLATE_VERSION] ([TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION])
2. Fill in all metadata fields with actual values, not placeholders

## **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE**

### **Digital Experience-First Implementation Approach**
When implementing this digital capability, prioritize user value and experience quality over technical convenience.

**Start With User Research:**
Validate user needs and capability assumptions before building features.

**Build Minimum Viable Experience:**
Focus on core user value in initial implementation, then enhance based on user feedback.

**Design for Accessibility:**
Build accessibility considerations into the foundation rather than adding them later.

**Test with Real Users:**
Continuously validate experience decisions with actual users throughout implementation.

### **Frontend Implementation Strategy**
**Component-Based Architecture:**
Build reusable interface components that can evolve with user needs.

**Progressive Enhancement:**
Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript, then enhance with interactive features.

**Performance Optimization:**
Optimize for user-perceived performance, especially on mobile devices.

### **Implementation Build Sequence**
**Phase 1: Foundation** (Features with no frontend dependencies)
- [ ] **[Basic UI Components]**: [Core interface elements] - Depends on: Design System
- [ ] **[Authentication Flow]**: [User login capability] - Depends on: Backend Auth Service

**Phase 2: Core Experience** (Features building on Phase 1)
- [ ] **[Primary User Action]**: [Main capability] - Depends on: Basic UI, Backend Domain API
- [ ] **[Data Display]**: [Information presentation] - Depends on: Basic UI, Data APIs

**Phase 3: Enhanced Experience** (Features requiring multiple dependencies)
- [ ] **[Advanced Feature]**: [Complex user capability] - Depends on: Primary User Action, Data Display
- [ ] **[Integration Feature]**: [Cross-system capability] - Depends on: External Service API

### **Common Implementation Patterns**
**State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// Focus on user intent and digital capability state
interface DigitalCapabilityState {
  currentStep: CapabilityStep;
  userContext: UserContext;
  completedActions: CompletedAction[];
  availableNextActions: AvailableAction[];
}
```

**User Action Pattern:**
```typescript
// Actions express user intent, not technical operations
interface UserAction {
  intent: UserIntent;
  context: ActionContext;
  expectedOutcome: ExpectedOutcome;
}
```

**AI Implementation Guidance**
When implementing this digital capability:
1. **Follow build sequence** - Implement features in technical dependency order
2. **Establish backend integration first** - Ensure all required APIs and services are available
3. **Build UI components progressively** - Start with basic components, then compose into complex features
4. **Test user scenarios continuously** - Validate user experience at each build phase
5. **Maintain accessibility from foundation** - Build inclusive experiences from the beginning, not as an afterthought

**Human Review Focus Areas**
- **User research accuracy**: Does the capability reflect actual user needs and behaviors?
- **Experience flow**: Are capability steps logical and efficient for users?
- **Integration design**: Do backend integrations support optimal user experiences?
- **Accessibility compliance**: Does the design meet accessibility standards and best practices?
