2. TIME REFERENCE REMOVAL:
   - NEVER include time estimates (minutes, hours, days) in any section
   - Use complexity indicators instead: "Simple task", "Complex implementation", "Multiple components"
   - Use dependency counts: "3 files to modify", "5 test cases required", "2 integrations needed"
   - Use completion metrics: "Until all tests pass", "Until build succeeds", "Until validation complete"

3. PRIORITY AND ORDERING:
   - Base ALL priorities on technical build dependencies, NOT business value
   - Sequence steps by: "Must complete X before Y can begin"
   - Use dependency-driven language: "Requires foundation components", "Depends on Step X.Y completion"
   - Avoid value judgments: "Important", "Critical", "High-priority" unless referring to technical blocking

4. TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION HANDLING:
   - These "TEMPLATE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS" sections are for AI template maintenance only
   - NEVER copy these sections to documents created from templates
   - Only copy content between the template instruction blocks to final documents
   - Remove ALL template instruction comments from generated documents

5. INSTRUCTION PROPAGATION RULES:
   - Template instructions (marked with "DO NOT INCLUDE IN FINAL") stay in templates only
   - Content instructions (for document creation) get copied to generated documents
   - Metadata fields (TEMPLATE_FILE, TEMPLATE_VERSION) get copied for traceability

FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WILL RESULT IN CORRUPTED TEMPLATE SYSTEM.

When creating a Concept ICP from this template:
1. Remove all sections marked with <!-- TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION -->
2. Replace all [bracketed placeholders] with actual content
3. This template is for DOCUMENTATION ONLY - no code implementation
4. Focus on clear business capability specifications
5. Ensure features are marked as "Not Implemented" with future ICP references
6. Each documentation phase should cover one logical documentation area

IMPORTANT: Do NOT reference ANY timeframes or duration estimates.
Instead use: document sections, feature counts, specification completeness, or dependency chains.

CRITICAL: Concept ICPs update documentation to specify future work.
They do NOT implement code. Implementation ICPs will reference these specs.

CAPABILITY REGISTRY INTERACTION:
When creating Concept ICPs:
1. If specifying NEW capabilities not yet documented:
   - Generate unique ID: [DOMAIN]-[NAME]-[4-random-chars]
   - Check /Documentation/ContextEngineering/capability-registry.md for conflicts
   - ADD new capability to registry with status "Not Started"
2. If updating existing capabilities:
   - Reference existing capability IDs from registry
   - Do NOT change registry status (concepts don't implement)
3. Always use capability IDs when referencing capabilities in documentation

TEMPLATE VERSIONING:
When creating ICPs from this template, ensure:
1. Use the TEMPLATE_FILE and TEMPLATE_VERSION defined above for metadata fields:
   - "Generated From Template" field: [TEMPLATE_FILE] v[TEMPLATE_VERSION]
   - "Template Version" field: [TEMPLATE_VERSION] ([TEMPLATE_DESCRIPTION])
2. Fill in all metadata fields with actual values, not placeholders

<!-- RATIONALE: Two-level protocol balances safety and efficiency. Level 1 (state block) is fast
     and handles 95% of rollovers. Level 2 (re-grounding docs) for uncertain cases. Provides
     systematic recovery vs unpredictable failures. -->

**üîÑ CONTEXT ROLLOVER PROTOCOL**:

**LEVEL 1 (ALWAYS EXECUTE)**:
1. Read the state tracker block above (current phase/step/block)
2. Verify understanding of your current position in execution
3. Confirm last action completed and next action to take
4. Assess your confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**LEVEL 2 (EXECUTE IF CONFIDENCE < HIGH)**:
1. If uncertain about workflow, read: `.../context-engineering-kickstarter.md` (Tier 2 - Workflow patterns)
2. If uncertain about "why", read: `.../context-engineering-system.md` (Tier 3 - System concepts)
3. Return to this template for execution instructions (Tier 1 - Execution authority)

**IMPORTANT**: This template is Tier 1 (execution authority) - it contains all necessary instructions
for normal execution. Only reference Tier 2/3 if context rollover creates uncertainty.

## **CAPABILITY TRACKING (v5.0 - DECENTRALIZED)**
<!-- CRITICAL: These instructions MUST remain in generated Concept ICPs -->

<!-- RATIONALE: v5.0 removes capability-registry.md (central registry "never works properly").
     Tracking is now DECENTRALIZED to domain.req.md and digital.req.md files where capabilities
     are defined. This eliminates sync overhead while maintaining full traceability.
     Codification ICPs SPECIFY new capabilities in req files (status: "Not Implemented").
     Implementation ICPs IMPLEMENT capabilities (status: "Not Implemented" ‚Üí "Implemented"). -->

**Tracking Update Requirements:**
Capability specification tracking differs based on ICP source type:

### **For Standard Concept ICPs (Mature Domain Documentation):**

**For NEW Capabilities Being Specified:**
1. Open target `[Domain].domain.req.md` file
2. Add new capability section with:
   - Capability Name: [Clear descriptive name]
   - Status: "Not Implemented"
   - Created Date: Today's date
   - Implementation ICP: "TBD - awaiting implementation"
   - Specifications: [Detailed requirements]
3. If UI/UX related, also add to `[Capability].digital.req.md` with:
   - Status: "Not Implemented"
   - User journey specifications
   - Interface requirements

**For EXISTING Capabilities Being Enhanced:**
1. Open existing `[Domain].domain.req.md` file
2. Locate capability section
3. UPDATE specifications with enhancements
4. Do NOT change status (Codification ICPs specify, they don't implement)
5. Add "Last Updated" date and this ICP reference
6. If applicable: Update corresponding `[Capability].digital.req.md`

### **For NewConcepts Concept ICPs (Exploratory Documentation):**
**IMPORTANT**: NewConcepts create initial req files that will be moved to mature domains later.

**When Creating NewConcept Requirements:**
1. Create `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/NewConcepts/[concept-name].concept.req.md`
2. Specify all capabilities with status: "Not Implemented"
3. Use placeholder format for capability IDs: TEMP-[DOMAIN]-[NAME]-####
4. Document domain discovery notes (which mature domain this might belong to)
5. **NOTE**: Final domain.req.md placement happens after human approval

**When Working with Existing NewConcept Requirements:**
1. Update existing `/Documentation/ContextEngineering/NewConcepts/*.concept.req.md`
2. Maintain placeholder ID consistency
3. Track which mature domains capabilities might map to
4. Prepare domain assignment proposal for human approval

**Tracking Interaction Pattern:**
- **Standard Concepts**: ADD or UPDATE capability specs in domain.req.md and digital.req.md files
- **NewConcepts**: CREATE concept.req.md, propose domain assignment to human
- **NO CENTRAL REGISTRY** - All tracking is in requirement documents
- **VALIDATE**: Ensure all capability references have corresponding req file entries

## **DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENT PHASES**

<!-- 
TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION:
- Documentation phases should be smaller than implementation phases
- Each phase should cover one logical area of documentation
- Steps should focus on specific documentation sections
- Size by content scope, not time
-->

### **AI EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR DOCUMENTATION**
<!-- CRITICAL: AI must follow this sequence for EVERY documentation step -->

#### **üìã STREAMLINED WORKFLOW PROTOCOL (v5.0.1)**

**SINGLE APPROVAL GATE**: This template uses ONE comprehensive approval gate after planning, then continuous execution with progress tracking.

#### **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Complete Together)**
The AI will complete both analysis and planning before the single approval gate:

**ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES**:
- Read all referenced *.domain.md and *.digital.md files completely
- Note all existing feature specifications
- Identify gaps and inconsistencies
- Map cross-references between documents

**PLANNING ACTIVITIES**:
- List missing business rules to add
- List incomplete capabilities to expand
- List integration patterns to clarify
- Identify sections needing updates
- Plan cross-reference updates
- Generate complete change plan with specific file modifications

**OUTPUT**: Comprehensive change plan showing exactly what will be modified in which documents

#### **üõë SINGLE APPROVAL GATE üõë**
After planning is complete, AI MUST present comprehensive change plan and STOP for approval:
- Show all documents that will be modified
- Show specific sections and changes for each document
- Show features that will be added
- Show cross-references that will be updated
- Wait for explicit human approval to proceed

#### **Phase 2: Continuous Execution (After Approval)**
After receiving approval, AI executes all planned changes with progress logging:

**EXECUTION ACTIVITIES** (continuous, no stops between steps):
- Update all planned documents
- Add business rules to domain.md files
- Add capability details to digital.md files
- Mark features as "Not Implemented"
- Add ICP references for future work
- Update all cross-references

**VALIDATION ACTIVITIES** (continuous):
- Verify all cross-references resolve correctly
- Confirm terminology consistency
- Ensure features properly marked with status
- Validate integration patterns align
- Check for contradictions

**PROGRESS LOGGING** (required throughout):
- Log after each document modified
- Log after each validation check
- Update todo list with progress
- Track completion percentage

#### **Documentation Quality Checks**
Before marking any documentation step complete:
- [ ] All features include complete specifications
- [ ] Build order dependencies are logical
- [ ] Integration requirements are clear
- [ ] Cross-references are valid
- [ ] Terminology is consistent
- [ ] No contradictions with existing docs

### **AI Must ALWAYS:**
- Follow sequence: Analyze ‚Üí Expert Coordinate ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí **STOP** ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Complete
- Complete full analysis AND planning before the single stop
- Thoroughly review *.domain.md and *.digital.md files for context
- Use decentralized capability tracking (in req files, not central registry)
- Maintain consistent terminology across domain and digital documents
- Mark features as "Not Implemented" with future ICP reference
- Update cross-references across all affected documents
- Ensure domain rules align with digital capabilities
- Log progress continuously during execution phase
- Update todo list to track completion
- Generate comprehensive summaries at planning and completion stages

### **AI Must NEVER:**
- Stop during analysis or planning (complete both before stopping)
- Stop during execution after approval (execute continuously with logging)
- Skip documentation review steps
- Make changes without understanding context
- Skip expert coordination when enabled (v4.0.0)
- Skip progress updates or todo list updates
- Proceed past the single approval gate without explicit human approval

**AI Execution Guidance**
When enhancing documentation:
1. **Focus on business value** - Ensure all specifications clearly connect to business capabilities
2. **Leverage expert guidance** (v4.0.0) - Use VET MCP tools for architectural and domain validation
3. **Maintain domain boundaries** - Keep clear separation between different business domains
4. **Specify integration clearly** - Define precise contracts for cross-capability integration
5. **Achieve expert consensus** - Target ‚â•80% consensus for complex architectural concepts
6. **Enable implementation** - Provide sufficient detail for AI implementation without over-specifying
7. **Preserve human readability** - Use clear paragraphs and organized sections for human review

**Human Review Priorities**
- **Business accuracy**: Do specifications correctly represent business needs and capabilities?
- **Implementation clarity**: Can an AI successfully implement from these specifications?
- **Integration coherence**: Do cross-capability integrations make business and technical sense?
- **Completeness**: Are all necessary specifications present for successful implementation?
